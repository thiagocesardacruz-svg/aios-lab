# Fast Cash SOP

> **Source:** $100M Playbook: Fast Cash - Alex Hormozi
> **Pattern:** SC-PE-001 (SOP Extraction Standard)
> **Version:** 1.0.0

## Part 1: Purpose

Generate maximum cash in the shortest period possible from your warmest audiences. Fast Cash Plays are "winning lottery tickets you cash in once a quarter" - limited time offers designed to extract premium revenue from existing customers, previous customers, and engaged leads.

**Core Equation:**
```
Fast Cash Revenue = Number Sold x Premium Price
Example:
- 10 customers buy at $6,000 = $60,000
- 90% gross margins = $54,000 profit
- Quarterly execution = $200k+ annual profit boost
```

**10x The 10% Rule:**
```
If 10% of customers pay 10x the price = You double your revenue
- Already spent money to acquire them
- Extra revenue (minus delivery) = straight profit
- Sometimes 2x, 3x, 4x revenue from single customer segment
```

**Business Impact:**
- "Despite Cash Plays only being ~15% of my annual revenue, they were nearly half my profit"
- "Running even one Cash Play per year will pay for itself many years over"
- ROI Example: $300k/year business -> $529k/year with Fast Cash = 76% revenue increase, 4x net income

## Appendix A: Sample Email Templates

### Email 1: Announcement (Day 6 - Consult Path)
```
Subject: We need to talk

I'll keep this short. I want to help you [achieve your goal] faster. And, I want to make it
easier. And, I'm gonna make it cheaper for you. Crazy, I know. But there's a selfish reason I'm
doing this...

Main reason: Transparently, I want to invest in another [big expensive thing/person/vendor
that you planned on doing anyways], which will benefit you in these ways:
- Benefit 1 of the investment
- Benefit 2 of the investment
- Benefit 3 of the investment

So, as a way of saying thank you for supporting our business, for [10 customers] I'm going
to give you this ONE TIME ONLY DEAL - and - it will be only available this week.
EXPIRES SATURDAY AT MIDNIGHT PST.

What the first [10] people get:
- Savings: 20% off what you pay - for an entire year.

PLUS - something that other customers won't get.
- Premium speed feature
- Premium ease feature
- Premium access feature

So yes, you're going to GET MORE and PAY LESS than everyone else, in exchange for [pre-
paying for the year] so we can make this investment.

I'm limiting this to ten people only. Again, this is a one time only deal that I'm making you
because you helped me (and everyone else) so we could make this investment. It's also a huge
discount on my normal services, so I can't extend it to anymore people.

This is only going to customers. So, since you're already committed and investing in getting
[goal] I figured you're going to spend the money either way, might as well get the savings
now and enjoy the benefits the rest of the year.

If you want in - click this link to book a call on my calendar

ple. And, the offer expires at midnight Saturday - or - once the slots are filled. Whichever
comes first.

```

### Email 4: Scarcity Warning (Day 2)
```
Subject: 2 spots left + game changer

I'm honored and humbled to send this email out. We're well on our way to being able to
afford [investment] that will benefit everyone. We have two spots left for the [offer].

Eight of you have already taken me up on it. And it means the world. As my way of saying

XXX-XXXX.

[Your name]

PS - We'll probably hit the goal before the deadline, so if you're on the fence - get in now :)
```

### Email 5: Last Day AM
```
Subject: Saving $XXX ends tonight. Don't kick yourself tomorrow.

I've heard it from a few of you that are saying, "I'll wait until the next one!" and I wanted to
address it.
What if there is no "NEXT ONE"?
What if, by not taking action now, you don't make the "NEXT STEP" in your progress?

And maybe...the habit of waiting for the next one is why you aren't where you want to be
right now.

The truth is a whopping 41.7% of people will spend more on their cell phones and cars than
on their goals.

And the last time I checked, you will [be in your body/home/business] longer than that fan-
cy car and phones become obsolete the moment you open the box/drive it off the lot.

But [being in better shape/feeling safe in your home/building a profitable business] allows
you to do more, feed your family, and make the impact you want to have. In a nutshell, it
allows you to be more.

The [OFFER NAME] expires tonight at 7 pm, and while we have an EXTREMELY great
group of customers, I know there are a few more that should do it!

To get in, reply back to this message or text me at XXX-XXX-XXXX

Your Name Here

PS - [optional one line] Oh yea...one more thing...I'm also giving ONE MORE THING
away to the [X] customers who take me up on this offer:
- BONUS #5...
So in total, the next two people who decide to do this will get:
- [Premium feature]
- [Premium feature]
- [Premium feature]
- [ANOTHER Premium speed feature]
- And - BONUS #5
```

### Email 6: Last Day PM (Back-out)
```
Subject: RE: your goals we set

Hey, so it looks like someone backed out of our deal because of an unforeseen issue [moving
out of town, leaving the country, sick family member, etc]! And it's a bummer for them, but
it is great for YOU! Can I call you now to talk about it?

REPLY YES to this email - and I'll call you right away.
OR - text me "YES IM IN" at XXX-XXX-XXXX
```
