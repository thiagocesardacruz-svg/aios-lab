# SOP: Ad Angles Library & Framework

> **Source:** $100M Money Models Blueprint - Business Growth Ad Angles + Retargeting + Skool Trial + Launch Ads
> **Pattern:** SC-PE-001 (SOP Extraction Standard)
> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Extracted:** 2026-02-10
> **Cross-Reference:** See `goated-ads-sop.md` for ad assembly process, `hooks-sop.md` for hook deep-dive

## Part 1: Purpose

Build a library of battle-tested ad angles that can be adapted to ANY product/service launch. This SOP provides the specific ANGLES (the conceptual approach), while `goated-ads-sop.md` provides the PROCESS (how to assemble ads) and `hooks-sop.md` provides the TECHNIQUE (how to write hooks).

**Core Insight:**
> "You haven't saturated Facebook. But you have gotten all the low hanging fruit. You've hit a wall with your ad quality, not with the market."

**Why This SOP Exists:**
- Ad angles are the strategic layer between hooks and complete ads
- Same hook template can be used with different angles = exponential variation
- 42+ proven angles from actual $100M book launch = zero guesswork
- Each angle targets different psychological triggers and awareness levels

**The Angle Library Value:**
```
42 Main Angles × 10 Retargeting Angles × 14 Launch Angles × 14 Skool Trial Angles = 80+ Total Angles
Each angle can generate 3-5 hook variations
80 angles × 4 hooks each = 320+ unique ad starting points
```

## Part 2: Scope

### When This SOP Applies
- Creating ad campaigns for product/book launches
- Building retargeting sequences
- Creating trial/freemium offer ads
- Adapting proven angles to new niches

### When This SOP Does NOT Apply
- Hook writing technique (see `hooks-sop.md`)
- Ad assembly process (see `goated-ads-sop.md`)
- Landing page copy (different discipline)
- Organic content creation (different triggers)

## Part 5: The Complete Angle Library

### 5.1 RUMORS ARE TRUE ANGLES (6 Angles)

**Master Pattern:**
```
"The rumors are true... [Big claim that defies expectations]"
+ Contrast what people THINK vs. what's ACTUALLY true
+ Real examples (Netflix, Apple, Amazon)
+ Event/offer CTA
```

#### Angle RT-01: Big Companies Secret
**Source:** Ad #38
**Hook:** "The rumors are true... Big companies DO have an unfair advantage. But it's not what you think."
**Core Message:** The advantage is not money, products, or marketing - it's how they THINK about customers.
**Contrast Pattern:**
- Small business: "How do I get someone to buy my thing?"
- Big business: "How do I get someone to keep buying my things?"

**Example Flow:**
```
Small business approach:
• Sell $500 course
• Hope customer is happy
• Maybe they buy again someday

Big business approach:
• Give away $500 course for free
• Sell $200/month implementation program
• Upsell $5,000 done-for-you service
• Keep helping them scale with new offers

Same customer. More value. 10x more revenue.
```

**Adaptation Template:**
```
"The rumors are true... [Industry leaders] DO have [advantage]. But it's not what you think.
It's not [obvious thing 1]. It's not [obvious thing 2]. It's not [obvious thing 3].
The real advantage? [Counterintuitive truth].
[Your avatar] thinks: '[Surface-level question]'
[Industry leaders] think: '[Deeper question]'
[Concrete example showing the difference]"
```

#### Angle RT-02: Rich vs Broke Owners
**Source:** Ad #39
**Hook:** "The rumors are true... Rich business owners ARE different from broke business owners. But not how you think."
**Core Message:** Rich owners make money from CUSTOMERS, broke owners make money from SALES.
**Analogy:** Digging for gold with a spoon vs. heavy machinery.

#### Angle RT-03: Overnight Success
**Source:** Ad #40
**Hook:** "The rumors are true... Some businesses DO become 'overnight successes.' But not how the media tells it."
**Core Message:** They cracked the code on customer economics ($3-5 return per $1 spent vs. $1.20).
**Analogy:** Money printing machine vs. piggy bank.

#### Angle RT-04: Million Dollar Secret
**Source:** Ad #41
**Hook:** "The rumors are true... There IS a million-dollar secret that successful entrepreneurs don't want you to know."
**Core Message:** It's not a product/service/tactic - it's a way of THINKING (transactions vs. relationships).
**Concrete Example:**
```
Transaction: Sell $2,000 website, move on
Relationship: Build $2,000 website → $500/mo hosting → $1,000/mo marketing → $300/mo maintenance → $50,000+ over time
```

#### Angle RT-05: Unfair Advantage
**Source:** Ad #42
**Hook:** "The rumors are true... Some businesses DO have an unfair advantage. And it's 100% legal."
**Core Message:** Customer mathematics (broke math vs. rich math).
**The Math:**
```
Broke Math:
• Spend $100 → Make $120 → $20 profit → Reinvest slowly → Compete on price

Rich Math:
• Spend $100 → Make $400 → $300 profit → Reinvest aggressively → Compete on value
```

#### Angle RT-06: The Original
**Source:** Ad #1
**Hook:** "The rumors are true... There IS a secret that big companies use to crush their competition."
**Examples Used:** Netflix (free trial → monthly), Apple (phone → apps → upgrades), Amazon (free shipping → buy everything).

### 5.2 QUESTION HOOK ANGLES (4 Angles)

**Master Pattern:**
```
[Direct question that gets them to engage]
+ Flip the question to the REAL problem
+ Show the math/logic
+ Event/offer CTA
```

#### Angle QH-01: Quick Question
**Source:** Ad #2
**Hook:** "Quick question: What's your email?"
**Core Message:** Most owners solve the WRONG problem (more customers vs. more revenue per customer).
**The Flip:**
```
They think they need:
❌ More customers
❌ Better ads
❌ Cheaper leads
❌ More traffic

Real question: "How do I make more money from each customer?"
```

#### Angle QH-02: You Don't Need Cheaper Leads
**Source:** Ad #3
**Hook:** "You don't need cheaper leads. You need a better money model."
**The Math:**
```
Business A: $20 leads → $60 per customer
Business B: $50 leads → $250 per customer

Who's winning? Business B - by a lot.
```

#### Angle QH-03: Is It Possible
**Source:** Ad #4
**Hook:** "Is it possible to 3x your customer value in 90 days? Yes. Here's how:"
**Contrast:**
```
Single Transaction Thinking: $500 per customer
Money Model Thinking: $1,500+ per customer
```
**Analogies:**
- Selling one book vs. getting them to join your library
- Selling one meal vs. getting them to become a regular

#### Angle QH-04: A Lot of People Ask Me
**Source:** Ad #14
**Hook:** "A lot of people ask me what's better: getting more customers or getting more money from customers you already have."
**Analogy:** Filling a bucket with holes - fix the holes first, then every drop stays.

---

### 5.3 COMPARISON/CONTRAST ANGLES (8 Angles)

**Master Pattern:**
```
[Two options or scenarios]
+ Clear distinction between approaches
+ Math/logic that makes choice obvious
+ Event/offer CTA
```

#### Angle CC-01: Small vs Big Business
**Source:** Ad #22
**Hook:** "Small business vs. Big business - what's the difference?"
**Pattern:**
```
Small: Make one offer → Customer buys or doesn't → Move on → Repeat forever
Big: Make one offer → Customer buys → Make another → Buys again → Make another → Customer becomes a fan
```

#### Angle CC-02: $100K vs $1M Owner
**Source:** Ad #16
**Hook:** "$100K business owner: 'I need more customers.' $1M business owner: 'I need better systems.'"
**Key Insight:** $100K owners solve problems once. $1M owners solve problems forever.

#### Angle CC-03: Smart vs Dumb
**Source:** Ad #32
**Hook:** "Smart business owners make money from customers. Dumb business owners make money from products."
**Contrast:**
```
Dumb: Create better product, lower prices, work harder, need more customers
Smart: Understand customers better, solve more problems, work smarter, need better customers
```

#### Angle CC-04: Company A vs Company B
**Source:** Ad #12
**Hook:** "Company A spends $100 to get a customer and makes $120 back in 30 days. Company B spends $100 and makes $380 back."
**Outcome:** Company B can spend 3x on ads → gets 3x customers → dominates market → Company A goes out of business.

#### Angle CC-05: Product vs Customer Focus
**Source:** Ad #37
**Hook:** "What happens when you design your business around customers instead of products?"
**Real Example:**
```
Product-focused lawyer: "I sell legal services for $200/hour."
Customer-focused lawyer: "I solve business problems. Legal services are just one tool I use."
```

#### Angle CC-06: Slow Path vs Fast Path
**Source:** Ad #33
**Hook:** "How long does it take to go from broke business owner to millionaire?"
**The Two Paths:**
```
Slow (10-20 years): Start → Hope people buy → Reinvest slowly → Scale gradually
Fast (2-5 years): Start → Design systems → Reinvest aggressively → Scale exponentially
```

#### Angle CC-07: 95% vs 5%
**Source:** Ad #34
**Hook:** "In the next 60 seconds, I'm going to show you why 95% of businesses struggle and 5% get rich."
**The Math:**
```
Struggling: $100 → $120 → $20 profit → Can't afford to grow
Rich: $100 → $400 → $300 profit → Can afford to outspend everyone
```
**Real Example (Gym):**
```
Struggling gym: $100/month × 3 months = $300 total
Rich gym: $600 challenge + $200 supplements + $100/mo × 12 = $2,000 total
```

#### Angle CC-08: Price Setters vs Price Takers
**Source:** Ad #13
**Hook:** "In every market, there are two types of businesses: Price setters and price takers."
**Example:**
```
Business A: Sells consulting for $5,000. One service. One payment. Done.
Business B: Assessment $500 → Strategy $2,000 → Implementation $5,000 → Support $1,000/month
```

### 5.4 TRANSFORMATION ANGLES (6 Angles)

**Master Pattern:**
```
"I went from [bad state] to [good state]"
+ Same business, same customers, same ads
+ What changed: HOW I thought about customers
+ Before/After specifics
+ Event/offer CTA
```

#### Angle TR-01: Losing to Winning
**Source:** Ad #5
**Hook:** "I went from losing $20 on every customer to making $240 profit from every customer."
**Before/After:**
```
Before:
• Run ads → Get customers → Sell $100 → Spend $120 getting them → Lose $20 → Go broke

After:
• Run ads → Get customers → Sell $100 → Immediately sell $200 more → Follow up $160 → Get $50/month → $240 profit day one → Scale like crazy
```

#### Angle TR-02: If I Woke Up Tomorrow
**Source:** Ad #7
**Hook:** "If I woke up with a struggling business tomorrow, and wanted to fix it by December, here's exactly what I would do:"
**90-Day Plan:**
```
Month 1: Figure out what's broken
• How customers find me
• Where they get confused
• Why they don't buy
• How much each customer worth

Month 2: Fix the broken stuff
• Make it easier to understand
• Give more reasons to buy
• Create backup offers
• Build ways to sell more later

Month 3: Test everything
• Try one thing at a time
• Keep good, throw out bad
• More money, less work
```
**Key Insight:** Think like an architect, not a firefighter.

#### Angle TR-03: Client Got Results
**Source:** Ad #8
**Hook:** "One of my portfolio companies got a 7.5x increase in profit per location without spending more on ads."
**The Numbers:**
```
Old: Make $97 per customer
New: Make $694 per customer on average

How: $97 → Immediately $300 → Follow up $200 → Monthly $97/month
```

#### Angle TR-04: 8 Years Learning
**Source:** Ad #35
**Hook:** "It took me 8 years to learn this, but I'm going to teach you how in 90 minutes."
**The Lesson:** You don't make money from products - you make money from CUSTOMERS.
**What 8 Years Taught:**
```
Customers don't want products → They want results
Customers don't want features → They want benefits
Customers don't want to buy once → They want ongoing relationships
Customers don't want cheap → They want value
```

#### Angle TR-05: If I Only Had 90 Days
**Source:** Ad #26
**Hook:** "If I only had 90 days in a brand new town with zero connections, this is exactly what I would do to build a million-dollar business."
**The Plan:**
```
Day 1-30: Find the money leak
• Look at how local businesses get customers
• Find the biggest leak in their system
• Pick the business with the biggest leak

Day 31-60: Fix the leak for free
• Show them how much they're losing
• Fix it free to prove it works
• Document everything
• Get results they can't ignore

Day 61-90: Scale the solution
• Offer to fix same problem for competitors
• Charge based on results, not time
• Use success stories to get more clients
• Build system that works without me
```

#### Angle TR-06: First Millionaire in Family
**Source:** Ad #28
**Hook:** "Want to be the first millionaire in your family?"
**The Truth:**
- Not working harder (parents worked harder)
- Not being smarter (grandparents survived wars)
- Not better opportunities (they built from scratch)

**What's Different:** Information.
```
The millionaire system:
Step 1: Find people with problems
Step 2: Solve their problems for money
Step 3: Make more money from each person
Step 4: Get them to pay repeatedly
Step 5: Reinvest to help more people
```

+ Event/offer CTA
```

#### Angle SF-01: Two Types of Owners
**Source:** Ad #10
**Hook:** "There are two types of business owners: Type 1: 'How do I get more customers?' Type 2: 'How do I make more money from each customer?'"
**Type Breakdown:**
```
Type 1 thinking: More traffic, better ads, more sales, work harder
Type 2 thinking: Better systems, smarter offers, happier customers, work smarter
```

#### Angle SF-02: Pattern Recognition
**Source:** Ad #11
**Hook:** "I've been obsessed with one question: Why can some businesses spend unlimited money on ads while others can barely afford to advertise?"
**The Pattern:**
```
1. Get customers cheaper than competitors
2. Make more money from each customer
3. Get customers to buy again and again
4. Reinvest profits to get even more customers
```
**Compound Effect Questions:**
```
What if you could:
• Cut your customer cost in half?
• Double what each customer pays you?
• Get 30% more people to say yes?
• Turn one-time buyers into monthly payers?
```

#### Angle SF-03: Everyone Tells You But Nobody Shows
**Source:** Ad #36
**Hook:** "Everyone tells you to 'increase customer lifetime value' but nobody actually shows you how to do it."
**5-Step System:**
```

Step 2: Find the gaps
Step 3: Fill the gaps
Step 4: Connect the dots
Step 5: Test and improve
```

#### Angle SF-04: Business Model Theory
**Source:** Ad #9
**Hook:** "Most businesses work like this: Customer buys something. Business hopes they buy again someday. The end."
**Smart Business Pattern:**
```
Customer buys → Business immediately offers something else → Customer buys that too → Business offers another thing → Customer becomes a fan
```
**Real Examples:**
```
Netflix: Free trial → Good shows keep watching → New shows keep paying → Recommendations keep hooked

```

#### Angle SF-06: 90% Losing Money
**Source:** Ad #29
**Hook:** "What if I told you that 90% of businesses are losing money on every customer... but they don't know it?"
**The Real Math:**
```
Average business thinks:
• Spend $100 → Make $300 lifetime → Sounds profitable!

Reality:
• "Lifetime" = 3-6 months
• Costs money to service
• Most only buy once

Real math:
• $100 to get customer
• $50 to service
• $120 from one purchase
• = LOSE $30 per customer
```

```

#### Angle TS-02: Did You Know Math
**Source:** Ad #21
**Hook:** "Did you know that if you could get just 50% more money from each customer, you could spend 50% more to get them?"
**The Cascade:**
```
You get more customers (because you can pay more)
→ Competitors get fewer (because they can't)
→ You grow, they shrink
→ Game over
```

#### Angle TS-03: Target Audience Double
**Source:** Ad #27
**Hook:** "If you're a business owner and you want to double your profits by fixing how you sell instead of getting more customers, then listen up."

  - IF level_4_product THEN use_book_knowledge_angles (BK-01 to BK-05)
  - IF level_5_most_aware THEN use_launch_trial_angles (LA-*, TF-*)
action: Match angle category to awareness level
confidence: HIGH
source: "Derived from Ad Distribution Analysis"
```

### DR-002: Angle Adaptation Rule
```yaml
rule: NEVER_COPY_DIRECTLY

action: Adapt structure, replace specifics
confidence: HIGH
source: "goated-ads-sop.md principle"
```

### DR-003: Angle Testing Ratio
```yaml
rule: ANGLE_TESTING_ALLOCATION
trigger: Weekly ad creation
condition:
  - 70% = Proven angles (your past winners)
  - 20% = Adjacent angles (different category, same awareness)
  - 10% = New angles (untested from library)
action: Maintain innovation balance per 70-20-10 framework
confidence: HIGH
source: "hooks-sop.md 70-20-10 framework"
```

### DR-004: Retargeting Angle Sequence
```yaml
rule: RETARGETING_SEQUENCE
trigger: Building retargeting campaign
condition:
  - Day 1-3: Use RT-01 (Quick Reminder), RT-02 (Still There)

  - Day 8-14: Use RT-05 (In Case You Forgot), RT-08 (Just Clarifying)
  - Day 15+: Use RT-09 (Your Benefits), RT-10 (Simple Reminder)
action: Progress from urgency to value reinforcement
confidence: MEDIUM [INFERRED from retargeting best practices]
source: "Retargeting_Ad_Angles_eCommerce.md"
```

### DR-005: Launch Angle Timing
```yaml
rule: LAUNCH_ANGLE_PROGRESSION
trigger: Building launch campaign
condition:
  - Pre-Launch (-14 to -7): Use LA-04, LA-12, LA-13 (anticipation)
  - Pre-Launch (-7 to -1): Use LA-03, LA-11, LA-14 (urgency)
  - Launch Day: Use LA-01, LA-02, LA-05, LA-06 (event energy)
  - Final Hours: Use LA-07, LA-08, LA-09, LA-10 (scarcity)
action: Match angle to campaign phase
confidence: HIGH
source: "Money_Models_Launch_Ads.md sequence"
```

### DR-006: Comparison Angle Selection
```yaml
rule: COMPARISON_BY_COMPLEXITY
trigger: Choosing comparison angle
condition:
  - IF simple_decision THEN use_CC-01, CC-03 (clear binary)
  - IF math_driven_audience THEN use_CC-04, CC-07 (numbers focus)
  - IF aspirational_audience THEN use_CC-02, CC-06 (identity focus)

## Part 7: Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: New Product, No Proof
**Trigger:** Launching product with no customer results yet
**Response:**
- Avoid proof-heavy angles (CC-04, SF-03, TR-03)
- Use framework/theory angles (SF-01, SF-02, SF-04)
- Use curiosity angles (RT-01 to RT-06)
- Build proof quickly, then expand angle usage

### Exception 2: Niche-Specific Language
**Trigger:** Avatar uses very specific terminology
**Response:**
- Adapt angle language to niche terms
- Example: "Money model" becomes "patient journey" for healthcare
- Example: "Customer value" becomes "client lifetime" for agencies
- Preserve structure, replace vocabulary

### Exception 3: High-Ticket vs Low-Ticket
**Trigger:** Product is >$5,000 or <$50
**Response:**
```
High-Ticket (>$5,000):
- Emphasize comparison angles (CC-02, CC-08)
- Use transformation proof (TR-03)
- Longer copy, more detail

Low-Ticket (<$50):
- Emphasize trial angles (TF-01 to TF-14)
- Use quick-win angles (TS-01, TS-03)
- Shorter copy, faster CTA
```

### Exception 4: B2B vs B2C
**Trigger:** Different buying psychology
**Response:**
```
B2B:
- Emphasize systems/logic angles (SF-01 to SF-06)
- Use math/economics angles (CC-04, CC-07)
- Focus on ROI language

B2C:
- Emphasize transformation angles (TR-01 to TR-06)
- Use aspiration angles (TR-06, CC-02)
- Focus on lifestyle language
```

### Exception 5: Retargeting Fatigue
**Trigger:** Same audience seeing too many retargeting ads
**Response:**
- Rotate through all 10 retargeting angles weekly
- After 30 days, pause retargeting completely for 7 days
- Return with fresh angles from main library adapted for retargeting
