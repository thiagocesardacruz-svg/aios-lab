# Squad Blueprint: Pricing Framework Executor
# Extracted from: Hormozi Pricing SOP
# Version: 1.0
# Date: 2026-02-10

squad:
  name: hormozi-pricing
  purpose: "Execute the Hormozi Premium Pricing Framework to maximize revenue while maintaining customer value perception"
  extracted_from: "pricing-framework-sop.md"

  # Based on Hormozi's own team structure for pricing decisions
  philosophy: |
    "The fastest way to make more money is to charge more money for the same thing."
    - Price is the only decision Warren Buffet personally controlled at See's Candies
    - Testing on new customers first, then rolling out to existing base
    - Annual price review is non-negotiable
