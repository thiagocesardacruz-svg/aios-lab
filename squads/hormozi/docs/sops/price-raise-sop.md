# Price Raise SOP

> **Source:** $100M Playbook: Price Raise - Alex Hormozi
> **Pattern:** SC-PE-001 (SOP Extraction Standard)
> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Extracted:** 2026-02-10
> **Complements:** [Pricing Framework SOP](./pricing-framework-sop.md)

## Part 1: Purpose

Transform existing customer pricing to higher rates without losing the customer base. The Price Raise process maximizes **net revenue impact** through strategic communication, loyalty management, and churn mitigation.

**Core Equation:**
```
Net Revenue Impact = (New Price × Retained Customers) - (Old Price × All Customers)

Example (Trey's Gym):
- Old: $49/mo × 200 members = $9,800/mo → losing $2,000/mo
- New: $147/mo × 80 members = $11,760/mo → profit $4,000/mo
- Net Impact: +$6,000/mo (from negative to positive)
```

**Business Impact:** Even losing 60% of customers while tripling price resulted in massive profit swing. The key is knowing your breakeven point before executing.

**Source Reference:** Page 1-2 - "Trey's business went from bleeding $2,000 a month to pocketing $4,000 in profit. And all this only took a week to roll out."

## Part 5: Process Steps

### PHASE I: PREPARATION

#### Step 1.1: Test New Price on New Customers First
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Validate new price point converts and retains at profitable rates |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis (data collection and interpretation) |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - A/B testing, conversion tracking |
| **Executor** | Worker (tracking) + Human (decision) |
| **Precondition** | New pricing hypothesis defined |
| **Output** | Conversion rate, churn rate, LTV at new price |
| **Guardrails** | Minimum 2-4 weeks of data before proceeding |
| **Decision Rule** | "Knowing other people have said yes without hesitation will give you confidence when you present it to the rest of your customer base" |

**Rationale:** Testing on new customers provides two benefits: (1) data to prove profitability, (2) confidence when presenting to existing base.

**Source Reference:** Page 6 - "Test price raises on new customers before rolling out to your entire customer base. First, this gives you data to see if it actually makes you more money."

#### Step 1.2: Calculate Breakeven Point
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Determine maximum acceptable churn before losing money |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis (mathematical calculation) |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Spreadsheet formula |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Current revenue and new price defined |
| **Output** | Breakeven churn percentage |
| **Guardrails** | Always know this number before communicating |
| **Decision Rule** | "You should know what percentage of customers you can lose and still make money before raising your prices" |

**Formula:**
```
Maximum Acceptable Churn = 1 - (Old Price / New Price)

Example:
- Old Price: $10
- New Price: $20
- Max Churn: 1 - ($10/$20) = 50%
- Meaning: Even losing 50% of customers = same revenue
```

**Source Reference:** Page 7-8 - "Do the math. You should know what percentage of customers you can lose and still make money before raising your prices."

#### Step 1.3: Segment Existing Customers
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Identify all customers on legacy pricing |
| **Cognitive Type** | Perception (data organization) |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - CRM query |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | CRM with pricing data |
| **Output** | Segmented customer list with tenure data |
| **Guardrails** | Include tenure length for personalization |
| **Decision Rule** | "Segment out 'old' customers that came before the price raise" |

**Source Reference:** Page 23 (Checklist) - "Segment out 'old' customers that came before the price raise."

---

### PHASE II: COMMUNICATION PREPARATION

#### Step 2.1: Section R - Document Value Delivered
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | List 1-5 bullets of specific value provided to customer |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis (compiling evidence) |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Data pull automated, compilation human |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Customer usage/success data available |
| **Output** | Personalized value bullets per customer |
| **Guardrails** | Personalize to greatest degree possible |
| **Decision Rule** | "The more you can personalize, the better" |

**Template:**
```
"Over the past 12 months, we've added so much value to [PRODUCT]:
  - We've made you X
  - Feature A helped you do Y
  - Feature B is great and you use it daily"
```

**Investment Categories (frame as customer benefits):**
- Hiring better people
- Training the people you have
- Better Equipment
- Better Technology/Software
- Facility Upgrades
- Higher level of service

**Source Reference:** Page 10 - "Start by reminding them of all the stuff you do - and the subsequent value they have gotten from your product or service since they have been a customer."

#### Step 2.2: Section A - State the Price Change
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Directly communicate the price increase |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution (clear statement) |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Template-based |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | New price determined |
| **Output** | Single clear sentence about price change |
| **Guardrails** | Don't waste time or hedge - rest of letter softens blow |
| **Decision Rule** | "Rip off the bandaid. Don't waste time." |

**Template:**
```
"For us to continue to invest in making [PRODUCT] for you and the
[COMPANY NAME] team, we need to increase our prices."
```

**Source Reference:** Page 10 - "Rip off the bandaid. Don't waste time. The rest of the letter will soften the blow. It's usually a single sentence."

#### Step 2.3: Section I - Describe Future Investments
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Explain what extra revenue will enable |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis + Creativity |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires strategic thinking |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Actual planned improvements |
| **Output** | 3 investment bullets with customer benefits |
| **Guardrails** | Only list things you're actually going to do |
| **Decision Rule** | "Don't say things you're not going to do (that's lying)" |

**Framework for Each Investment:**
```
Investment → More Good Stuff OR Less Bad Stuff

More Good Stuff: more aligned with desired outcome, faster, easier, risk free
Less Bad Stuff: misaligned with desired outcome, slower, harder, riskier
```

**Examples:**
- Hiring & retaining great people → build features OR higher service level OR faster response
- Equipment → use this rather than paying separately OR better widgets faster
- Technology/Software → experience faster and more accurate
- Facility Improvements → elevate experience

**Source Reference:** Page 11 - "Frame the price increase in the context of the value you are going to keep providing them. You don't want to look like a greedy bast*rd."

#### Step 2.4: Section S - Structure Loyalty Discount
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Define expiring discount for existing customers |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment (balancing retention vs. revenue) |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Rules-based with human override |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | New price and transition timeline defined |
| **Output** | Discount amount and expiration timeline |
| **Guardrails** | 3-6 month window typical; can stair-step if large increase |
| **Decision Rule** | "People are more 'okay' with a vanishing discount than they are a raise in price" |

**Template:**
```
"You've been insanely loyal to us the past X months/years. As of today
we're raising prices on new customers, but since you've been so loyal
we're going to keep you on your existing plan for the next (3 to 6 months).
So we are giving you a [$XXXX credit] as a way of saying thank you
(after which we'll nudge you up to the new price of $XXX)."
```

**Stair-Step Option (for large increases):**
```
"We'll give you $200/mo off for the first 4 months, then $100/mo off,
then $50/mo off last three months."
```

**Source Reference:** Page 12 - "People are more 'okay' with a vanishing discount than they are a raise in price. And - they mind even less when another discount appears in the future."

#### Step 2.5: Section E - Add PS Safety Valve
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Include escape hatch for truly affected customers |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment (empathy + protection) |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Template-based |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Response protocol defined |
| **Output** | PS statement appropriate to B2B or B2C |
| **Guardrails** | Must offer personal response, not generic support |
| **Decision Rule** | "Add in a line that says basically 'If this is gonna make you homeless or end your business, let me know, we'll figure something out.'" |

**Templates:**
```
B2C: PS - if this will materially affect your ability to buy groceries,
let me know and we'll work something out.

B2B: PS - if this materially impacts your business, let me know and
we'll work something out.
```

**Why This Works:** Most people won't claim hardship falsely, and those who do can be handled individually.

**Source Reference:** Page 13 - "This is not the time for 'it's not scalable' talk. Get ready to roll your sleeves up and respond to customers."

---

### PHASE III: EXECUTION

#### Step 3.1: Decide Delivery Method
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Choose letter, email, video, or individual meetings |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Strategic decision |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Price increase magnitude determined |
| **Output** | Delivery method selected |
| **Guardrails** | >50% increase requires individual meetings |
| **Decision Rule** | "Meet with people if you raise prices more than 50%" |

**Decision Matrix:**
| Increase Size | Delivery Method |
|--------------|-----------------|
| <50% | Letter/email with optional video |
| 50-100% | Video + individual calls for key accounts |
| >100% | Personal calls with all affected customers |

**Source Reference:** Page 6 - "Meet with people if you raise prices more than 50%. If you raise prices *a lot* - which usually happens when you made a *big* mistake early on - talk to them."

#### Step 3.2: Execute Video/Community Communication
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Post video announcement in community (if applicable) |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Personal delivery required |
| **Executor** | Human (Owner/Leader) |
| **Precondition** | Community/group exists |
| **Output** | Video posted with comments disabled |
| **Guardrails** | Turn off comments to prevent "bitch fest" |
| **Decision Rule** | "If you have the option to turn off comments, do so" |

**Implementation:**
1. Create video using RAISE letter as script
2. Post in community
3. Turn off comments
4. Refer all questions to direct contact

**Source Reference:** Page 15 - "If you have a community where your members congregate, you'll want to consider making a video like Trey did and posting it in there. If you have the option to turn off comments, do so. You don't want a b*tch fest in the comments."

#### Step 3.3: Send Communications
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Deliver price raise letter to all segmented customers |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Email automation with personalization |
| **Executor** | Worker (delivery) + Human (signing) |
| **Precondition** | Letter finalized, segments prepared |
| **Output** | All customers notified |
| **Guardrails** | Sign in ink if physical mail; sign personally if email |
| **Decision Rule** | "Sign in ink if possible. If not, sign the email personally." |

**Source Reference:** Page 23 (Checklist) - "Sign in ink if possible. If not, sign the email personally."

#### Step 3.4: Update New Customer Pricing
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Immediately apply new price to all incoming customers |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - System update |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Letter sent to existing customers |
| **Output** | Pricing updated across all acquisition channels |
| **Guardrails** | No delay - new customers have no context |
| **Decision Rule** | "Get new customers up to the new price immediately. No point in delaying that." |

**Handling New Customer Pushback:**
```
"That may feel like bad news but it's actually good news. First - it's good
news because we just keep making the value better. And, to give you some
confidence, 96% of our customers agreed. And they should know - they're
already using it. Beyond that - the good news is - this is the cheapest
it'll ever be. So there will never be a better time to get started."
```

**Source Reference:** Page 15-16 - "People moan, but they still buy. Just because someone wants something for less doesn't mean they won't buy it for more."

### PHASE IV: RESPONSE HANDLING

#### Step 4.1: Classify Response Types
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Categorize customer responses into three types |
| **Cognitive Type** | Perception + Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - AI can pre-classify, human validates |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Responses received |
| **Output** | Classified response list |
| **Guardrails** | Don't assume - let customer self-identify |
| **Decision Rule** | "You'll find there are three types of people" |

**Three Response Types:**
| Type | Description | Response Strategy |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Type 1 | See the value, don't like it but understand | No action needed |
| Type 2 | Actually affected financially | Extend discount 3-6 months |
| Type 3 | Were going to cancel anyway | Accept churn, no concession |

**Source Reference:** Page 13 - "Type #1: People who see the value. They may not like it. Nor should they. But they will understand and comply because they get enough value."

#### Step 4.2: Handle Type 2 (Actually Affected) Responses
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Provide extended terms for genuinely affected customers |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment + Negotiation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires human empathy |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Customer claimed genuine hardship |
| **Output** | Extended discount or modified terms |
| **Guardrails** | Give benefit of doubt; track for patterns |
| **Decision Rule** | "For key customers it actually affects, be ready to extend the terms of the discount for a longer period" |

**Response Script:**
```
"Don't worry, we got you. Why don't we extend your discount another
6 months, then reach out then. Is that fair?"
```

**Alternative (multiple smaller jumps):**
```
"Let's do this differently. Instead of one big jump, let's do three
smaller increases over 9 months. Fair?"
```

**Source Reference:** Page 13 - "Type #2: People actually affected. They will write you sob stories. This gives you optionality."

#### Step 4.3: Accept Type 3 (Pulled Forward) Churn
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Recognize and accept churn from customers who would have left anyway |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis (pattern recognition) |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Churn analysis automated |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | 30+ days post-announcement |
| **Output** | Churn pattern analysis |
| **Guardrails** | Don't chase customers who show Type 3 signals |
| **Decision Rule** | "You simply 'pulled forward' churn. Meaning, people who were going to cancel or not buy next month, just decide to do it a month sooner." |

**Expected Churn Pattern:**
```
Month 1: Increase in churn (pulled forward)
Month 2: Decrease in churn (below normal)
Month 3: Return to baseline
```

**Source Reference:** Page 13-14 - "You will get an increase in churn the first month, then a decrease in churn the month after (typically lower than normal). Then a return to baseline month three."

source: "People are more 'okay' with a vanishing discount" (p.12)
```

### DR-004: Response Classification
```yaml
rule: RESPONSE_HANDLING
trigger: Customer response received
condition:
  - IF response == "understand but don't like" THEN Type_1 → no_action()

```

---

## Part 7: Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: Extremely Large Increases (100x like Shopify Competitor)
**Trigger:** Price increase of 100x or more
**Context:** Shopify competitor took prices from $30 to $3000 (100x increase)
**Action:** Individual phone calls with EVERY affected customer
**Outcome:** Lost only 1 of 300 customers

**Source Reference:** Page 6 - "So the CEO hopped on the phone with those customers - all 300 of them - and they took their prices from $30 to $3000 on average (a 100x increase!). Wanna know how many they lost? One."

### Exception 2: Lifetime Deal Customers
**Trigger:** Customers on legacy "one time price for lifetime access"
**Action:** Do NOT grandfather indefinitely - plan transition
**Note:** "Every business owner I know who started this way ends up fixing it over time"

**Source Reference:** Page 6 - "Never sell a 'one time price' for lifetime access. Unless it truly costs you zero dollars to fulfill."

### Exception 3: Business-Critical Emergency (Like Trey)
**Trigger:** Business hemorrhaging cash, closure imminent
**Action:** Skip extended testing, execute full price raise immediately
**Note:** "In 12 more weeks, you won't have a gym. Which means zero members. It's do or die."

**Source Reference:** Page 1-2 - "Trey, in 12 more weeks, you won't have a gym. Which means zero members. It's do or die."

### Exception 4: Pairing with Launch
**Trigger:** Major product launch within 90 days
**Action:** Frame price raise as "early adopter pricing" transition
**Benefit:** Draft off launch momentum

**Source Reference:** Page 6 - "If you can, pair a price raise within 90 days of a launch. Every business has new products or promotions that launch. The best time to do a price raise is in the same quarter as a launch."

### Exception 5: Handling "Friend Told Me It Was Cheaper" Objection
**Trigger:** New customer references friend's lower price
**Response:**
```
"That may feel like bad news but it's actually good news. First - it's good news
because we just keep making the value better. And, to give you some confidence,
96% of our customers agreed. And they should know - they're already using it.
Beyond that - the good news is - this is the cheapest it'll ever be. So there
will never be a better time to get started."
```

**Source Reference:** Pages 17-20 - Complete gym price increase letter

```
Dear [Name],

As you may or may not know, we are going on [years/months] of being open
as of next month.

As you most likely have seen, we have grown a tremendous amount over this
period of time. A letter with black-and-white words can never communicate
how deeply grateful I am to you for being a part of this journey. You have
honored us with your patronage, and I want to honor you with transparency
and with a significant improvement to the level of service you have been
receiving. We want to truly transform lives, not just say we are.

To live up to this, I wanted to make you aware of the effort we put into
this on a continual basis, and what is coming down the pipeline, which
the coaching staff and I are incredibly excited about.

A few of the upcoming improvements are as follows.

WHAT WE CURRENTLY DO
1. Hire and Retain The Best Coaches: We strive to hire trainers who are
   sharp and have tremendous work ethic and warm hearts. We strive to
   replace the traditional model of fitness—watching the clock, counting
   reps, lack of enthusiasm, lack of knowledge or personalization—with
   a friendly face that knows your name, top-notch coaching, and motivation.

2. Offer Continued Education: The best coaches in the industry are the best
   because they invest in their education. We continuously invest in our
   coaches' education like [certifications/workshops].

3. Provide New Equipment: As we continue to learn about new training systems
   and methodologies, we continue to invest in up-to-date equipment.

WHAT IS COMING
1. Facility Improvements: We're a lot like the Millennium Falcon: we ain't
   pretty, but we'll get you there… fast.

2. Member Events: To further build this community and connect you all with
   one another, we are planning on hosting events.

3. Specialty Programs: We will also be rolling out specialty programs to
   those members who would like more attention.

4. A MASSIVE Improvement to the Level of Service: We are planning on
   changing the programming from a «come whenever you can» to «you now
   have an appointment with a trainer 3x per week.»

Now, all of these continued investments and upgrades in the level of service
we provide you will require significant funds to become reality.

And to continue to stay aligned with our mission to provide a remarkable
experience for our clients, we will be implementing a change in billing
structure. Instead of «unlimited come whenever you want,» we will be
switching to weekly billing. This switch will be an increase of about
$10–$15/week depending on your current membership. But the final result
will be $39/week with an effective date of [MM/DD/YYYY].

For those of you concerned about the $10–$15/week, I want you to know we
are simultaneously launching a Refer-a-Friend program where you get a
full month of service for every friend you refer who signs up as a client.

Now, let's be super real. Human beings HATE change. But we also understand
on some level that change is a part of growth. What I do NOT want under any
circumstances is for a gossip mill to be started. So my team and I will be
happy to address any questions you have related to the change in person.

Not via text…or FB Messenger…or Instagram DM…or email…or on a Facebook
thread (God help us all).

We want to talk IN PERSON.

I hope I have your support in allowing us to continue to serve you in the
best way we know how.

Respectfully yours,
(Hand-signed)
YOUR NAME
Owner, GYM NAME

P.S. I love you all, seriously.
