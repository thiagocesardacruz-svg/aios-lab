      Design upsell offers that maximize 30-day profit.
      "You can't have X without Y"

    core_principle: |
      When an offer solves a problem, another appears.
      You upsell the solution to the problem your offer reveals.

    offer_toolkit:
      classic_upsell:
        formula: "You can't have X without Y"

        tactics:
          - "Most profitable upsells first"
          - "'You don't want anything else, do you?' (No = Yes)"
          - "Surprise and delight: give ALL bonuses even if accept early"
          - "Hyper-buying cycle: weddings, babies, new hobbies"
          - "Free bonuses CREATE problems that upsells solve"
          - "Faster access = higher value = higher acceptance"
          - "Bundle upsells and NAME them (transformation package)"
          - "BAMFAM: Book A Meeting From A Meeting"
          - "Integrate upsells into delivery of other offers"

        examples:
          car_rental: "car → insurance → gas → late checkout (5.2x)"
          gym: "fitness → supplements ($5-10k/day)"
          coat_dealer: "storage → ear protectors → $30 additional storage"

      menu_upsell:
        formula: "Unsell → Prescribe → A/B → Card on File"

        economist_play: |
          A ($59), B ($125), A+B ($125) → 80% choose combo
          Make C same price as most expensive single option.

      anchor_upsell:
        formula: "Premium first → Gasp → Rescue → Main offer → Payment"

        steps:
          - "Present the anchor (5-10x price)"
          - "Wait for the gasp"
          - "Come to rescue: 'Do you care about [premium feature]?'"
          - "Present main offer"
          - "Ask how they want to pay"

        critical_rule: |
          Treat anchor as REAL offer. If fake, they know. You lose trust.
          Some WILL buy premium → massive profit.

        quote: |
          "The only thing worse than making a $1,000 offer to someone with
          a $100 budget is making a $100 offer to someone with a $1,000 budget."

      rollover_upsell:
        formula: "Credit previous purchase toward next, bigger purchase"

        situations:
          - "REENGAGE old customers (6+ months)"
          - "RESCUE angry customers (instead of refund)"
          - "STEAL competitor's unhappy customers"
          - "UPSELL current customers (distribute credit)"

        pricing: "Upsell at least 4x the credit → max 25% discount"

        gift_card_play: |
          Sell $200 gift cards for $20. Limit to two per customer.
          Only for giving to others. When they come, roll the gift card.
          Make card value 20% of next offer price.
          Customers PAY YOU to refer friends.

    anti_pattern: |
      Car salesman lowered same insurance from $5,000 to $400.

  continuity-architect:

    purpose: |
      Design continuity offers that maximize LTV with recurring payments.
      "You can shear a sheep for its whole life, but you can only skin it once."

    core_principle: |
      Continuity alone hard to advertise profitably.
      After attraction/upsell/downsell cover costs → continuity = predictable growth.

    offer_toolkit:
      continuity_bonus:
        formula: "Amazing bonus for subscribing today. Bonus value > first payment."

        types:
          products: "$800 in dog toys free with $59/month dog food subscription"
          services: "$1,000 accelerator free with $100/month membership"
          digital: "All 40 past newsletters ($15,880) with $399/month subscription"

        pricing_vs_standalone:
          fifty_percent: "Standalone = 1.33x monthly"
          sixty_percent: "Standalone = 1.66x monthly"

          eighty_percent: "Standalone = 2.33x monthly"
          ninety_percent: "Standalone = 2.66x monthly"

        bulk_upsell: |
          Pre-paid bulk (buy 5 get 1 free)
          1 in 8 taking this = 50% more 30-day profit

        tactics:
          - "Focus on the BONUS, not the membership"
          - "Make bonuses from things you ALREADY have"
          - "Physical bonus with digital, digital bonus with physical"
          - "Titles after 3, 6, 12 months (silver, gold, diamond)"
          - "Stack bonuses: sell benefit of each, show individual values"

      continuity_discount:
        formula: "Free time with commitment"

        examples:
          - "3 months free with 12-month commit" (25% off effective)
          - "Buy 6 months, get 6 months free" (50% off, doubles commitment)

        announcement_formats:
          - "Percentage: 25% off"
          - "Dollar: $300 off"
          - "Free portion: 3 months free"
          - "Total: 12 months for $900 (crossed $1,200)"

      waived_fee:
        formula: "Setup fee with m2m OR waived with annual commit"

        structure:
          option_a: "$5,000 setup + $1,000/month, cancel anytime"
          option_b: "$0 setup, commit 12 months at $1,000/month"
          early_exit: "Pay waived fee"
          result: "85% choose commitment. Churn <5%."

        why_it_works:
          - "People START to avoid fee"
          - "People STAY because leaving > staying"
          - "After commitment: fee disappears forever (equitable)"

        cause_based_cancellation: |
          "What cause do you absolutely HATE?"
          "If you cancel early, donating your fee to them."
          Double aversion = additional 50% churn reduction.

        setup:
          duration: "12 months minimum"
          fee: "3-5x monthly"
          early_exit: "Pay waived fee"
          red_flag: "If >5% want early exit → investigate product, not pricing"
