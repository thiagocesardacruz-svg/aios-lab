# Lead Nurture SOP

> **Source:** $100M Playbook: Lead Nurture - Alex Hormozi
> **Pattern:** SC-PE-001 (SOP Extraction Standard)
> **Version:** 1.0.0

## Part 1: Purpose

Transform leads who show interest into scheduled appointments who actually show up to buy. The Lead Nurture process maximizes **throughput** - the total percentage of engaged leads that show up to appointments.

**Core Equation:**
```
Throughput = Schedule Rate × Show Rate

Example:
- 100 Leads
- 50% Schedule Rate = 50 Appointments
- 50% Show Rate = 25 Shows
- Throughput = 25%
```

**Business Impact:** A 20-40% increase in show rates translates directly to revenue. At 20% margins, this means 2-3x profit increase.

---

## Part 2: Scope

### When This SOP Applies
- Leads have shown interest (opted in, filled form, responded to ad)
- Time between advertising and sales appointment
- Medium-term nurture: maximizing 30-day show rates

### When This SOP Does NOT Apply
- Long-term follow-up (emails, podcasts, content) - covered in other playbooks
- Pre-advertising lead generation
- Post-sale customer success

### Business Types
- Any business with scheduled appointments (phone, video, in-person)
- B2B and B2C
- High-ticket and low-ticket (adjust tactics accordingly)

## Part 5: Process Steps

### PILLAR I: AVAILABILITY

#### Step 1.1: Maximize Days Per Week
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Schedule appointments all 7 days per week |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis (operational decision) |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Calendar configuration |
| **Executor** | Worker (initial setup) → Human (staffing decisions) |
| **Precondition** | Business hours policy defined |
| **Output** | 7-day availability calendar |
| **Guardrails** | Staff rotation schedule required |
| **Decision Rule** | "You pay rent 7 days/week. Make money 7 days/week." |

**Rationale:** 5 days = 71% availability. 7 days = 100% availability. 40% more opportunity.

#### Step 1.2: Maximize Hours Per Day
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Extend appointment hours (target: 6am-6pm PST minimum) |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Calendar rules |
| **Executor** | Worker (config) → Human (staffing) |
| **Precondition** | Coverage capacity determined |
| **Output** | Extended hours calendar |
| **Guardrails** | Nationwide coverage: 9am-9pm EST recommended |
| **Decision Rule** | "Be available when customers are available to buy" |

#### Step 1.3: Increase Time Slot Flexibility
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Offer 4 scheduling options per hour (every 15 minutes) |
| **Cognitive Type** | Perception (customer convenience) |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Scheduler configuration |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Appointment duration defined |
| **Output** | 15-minute interval scheduler |
| **Guardrails** | May create gaps; use gaps for lead follow-up |
| **Decision Rule** | "Convenient for lead > convenient for business" |

#### Step 1.4: Enable Multi-Channel Scheduling
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Provide inbound, outbound, AND self-scheduling options |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker (self-schedule) + Hybrid (inbound/outbound) |
| **Precondition** | All channels configured |
| **Output** | Tri-channel booking system |
| **Guardrails** | Self-scheduler must have visible time slots, minimal steps |

**Self-Scheduler Optimization:**
1. Header confirms right place + next action + why
2. Available dates/times visible immediately (mobile + desktop)
3. Eliminate steps - don't ask info already provided
4. Show person's name/photo for human connection

| **Executor** | Worker (alert) → Human (call) |
| **Precondition** | Real-time lead notification system |
| **Output** | First contact completed |
| **Guardrails** | 60-second target for 391% conversion increase |
| **Decision Rule** | "If not hearing 'that was fast!' daily = too slow" |

**Statistics:**
- 391% increase in conversions when contacted in 60 seconds (Velocify)

| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Contact established |
| **Output** | Appointment scheduled <72h out |
| **Guardrails** | Same-day = best, never >5 days |
| **Decision Rule** | "Closer scheduling = higher show rate" |

**Appointment Outcomes (priority order):**
1. Close them NOW (talking right now = 100% show)
2. Hot handoff to active closer
3. Pull appointment forward to today
4. Confirm within 72h window
5. Remove unqualified from calendar

#### Step 2.3: Pull Appointments Forward
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

**Pull Forward Script:**
```
"Hey, this is [Name] calling from [Company] on a recorded line...
I saw you booked a time for [X] on [Day]. Just calling to confirm
some details before your appointment. Is now a terrible time?

[Qualify: WHO they are, WHAT they want, WHAT they've tried]

Okay great. Two things:
1. Good news: I think we can help you out.

#### Step 3.2: Qualify Leads
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Score leads and remove poor fits from calendar |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - AI can pre-score, human validates |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Qualification criteria defined |
| **Output** | Lead score (Red/Yellow/Green) |
| **Guardrails** | Canceling bad appointments = more time for good ones |

**Lead Scoring System:**
| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| GREEN | Prime lead | Priority routing to best closer |
| YELLOW | Less qualified | Standard process, "garbage man" opportunity |
| RED | Unqualified | Remove from calendar, offer downsell or resources |

some free products for you. Would you prefer face cream or hand lotion?"

[They respond with choice] = Implicit commitment to show
```

**A/B Offer Categories:**
- Quantity: One bottle or two?

### PILLAR IV: VOLUME

#### Step 4.1: First Week Contact Cadence
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Execute 7+ reach-out attempts in first week |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution (process following) |

| **Output** | Contact established or moved to long-term nurture |
| **Guardrails** | Front-load attempts; follow local laws |

**Day 1 (Opt-in Day):**
1. Call within 5 minutes
2. Double-dial immediately
3. Leave voicemail
4. Text immediately after voicemail
5. Double-dial + text two more times (hours apart)

**Days 2-3:**
- Call 2x per day (early + late)
- Text after second call each day

**Days 4-7:**
- Call + text 1x per day

- Re-engage triggers restart from top

#### Step 4.2: Automated Reminders
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Send system reminders at intervals before appointment |
| **Cognitive Type** | Memory/Retrieval |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Appointment scheduled |
| **Output** | Reminders delivered |
| **Guardrails** | Be transparent these are automated |

**Reminder Schedule:**
| Timing | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Immediately | Confirmation: time, date, caller number, person meeting with |
| 24 hours before | Reminder with details |
| 12 hours before | Reminder |
| 3 hours before | Final automated reminder |

**Reminder Template:**
```
[Auto msg] Hey [Name]! Quick reminder about your appointment
tomorrow at [time]. You'll be speaking with [Closer Name] from
[Area Code]. Looking forward to it!
```

#### Step 4.3: Manual Reminders
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Send personal reminders from real phone |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution + Personalization |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Must feel personal |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Appointment within 24 hours |
| **Output** | Personal connection established |
| **Guardrails** | Use iPhones (blue messages) for higher response |

**Manual Reminder Schedule:**
| Timing | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Night before | Personal check-in |
| Morning of | Confirmation |
| 60 minutes before | "See you soon" |

**Conversation Framework (A-C-A):**
1. **A**cknowledge: Respond to what they said
2. **C**ompliment: Something genuine about them
3. **A**sk: The next question (qualify or pull forward)

#### Step 4.4: BAMFAM (Book-A-Meeting-From-A-Meeting)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | NEVER end a call without scheduling the next one |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment + Negotiation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Currently on call with lead |
| **Output** | Next meeting scheduled |
| **Guardrails** | Treat "I'll get back to you" as objection to handle |
| **Decision Rule** | "BAMFAM as a way of life" |

**Script:**
```
[Before hanging up]
"Great, let me pull up my calendar... What day works better for you -
[Day A] or [Day B]? Perfect. Morning or afternoon? Great, I've got
you locked in for [specific time]. You'll get a confirmation shortly."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Both parties present = highest scheduling probability
- "I'll follow up later" = lead goes to no-man's land
- If they're dodgy about next call = objection to handle

## Part 6: Decision Rules

### DR-001: Speed Classification
```yaml
rule: SPEED_TO_CONTACT
trigger: New lead opt-in
condition:
  - IF contact_time < 60_seconds THEN "EXCEPTIONAL" (+391% conversion)
  - IF contact_time < 5_minutes THEN "STANDARD"
  - IF contact_time > 5_minutes THEN "SLOW" (revenue leak)
action: Prioritize immediate contact
confidence: HIGH (Velocify, HBR data)
```

### DR-002: Scheduling Window
```yaml
rule: APPOINTMENT_WINDOW
trigger: Scheduling conversation
condition:
  - IF available_slot == today THEN "PRIORITY" (highest show rate)
  - IF available_slot <= 72_hours THEN "ACCEPTABLE"
  - IF available_slot > 72_hours THEN "WARNING" (increased no-show risk)
  - IF available_slot > 5_days THEN "DISCOURAGE"
action: Always offer same-day first
confidence: HIGH (ALAN data)
```

### DR-003: Lead Scoring Action
```yaml
rule: LEAD_SCORE_ROUTING
trigger: Lead scored
condition:
  - IF score == GREEN THEN route_to_best_closer()
  - IF score == YELLOW THEN standard_process() # "Yellows are the new gold"
  - IF score == RED THEN remove_from_calendar() + offer_resources()
action: Match lead quality to closer quality
confidence: HIGH
```

### DR-004: Ghost Recovery
```yaml
rule: GHOST_DETECTION
trigger: Scheduled lead not responding
condition:
  - IF no_response AND hours_until_appointment < 24 THEN double_book_slot()
  - IF no_response AND days_since_schedule > 3 THEN send_proof()
  - IF ghosted_completely THEN add_to_90_day_nurture()
action: Never give up completely; show them what they missed
confidence: MEDIUM [INFERRED: specific thresholds]
```

### DR-005: Incentive Deployment
```yaml
rule: INCENTIVE_TYPE
trigger: Appointment scheduled
condition:
  - IF first_time_client THEN use_push_incentive() # Gift card
  - IF qualified_lead THEN use_pull_incentive() # A/B choice
  - IF high_value_lead THEN combine_both()
action: Create reciprocity and commitment
confidence: HIGH
```

### DR-006: Volume Escalation
```yaml
rule: CONTACT_ATTEMPT_ESCALATION
trigger: No response to contact
condition:
  - IF day == 1 AND attempts < 6 THEN continue_attempting()
  - IF day <= 3 AND attempts < 10 THEN continue_attempting()
  - IF day <= 7 AND attempts < 15 THEN continue_attempting()
  - IF day > 7 THEN transition_to_long_term_nurture()
action: Front-load contact attempts
confidence: HIGH
```

---

## Part 7: Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: Too Many Bad Appointments
**Trigger:** Calendar filled with unqualified leads
**Action:** Add friction to scheduling process
- Add video to watch before scheduler visible
- Add sales letter above scheduler
- Add price visibility
- Delay scheduler appearance

### Exception 2: Lead Can't Schedule Within 72h
**Trigger:** Lead unavailable in standard window
**Response:** Treat as objection, not fact
**Script:**
```
"What days were you planning on [activity related to offer]?
Great - this appointment is the first step to that. Let's use
that time slot for your appointment."
```

### Exception 3: High Show Rate, Low Close Rate
**Trigger:** Rep gets lots of shows but few closes
**Analysis:** May be cherry-picking easy leads
**Action:** Review lead quality distribution across team

### Exception 4: Lead Requests Different Closer
**Trigger:** Lead asks for someone else
**Action:** Accommodate if possible; investigate pattern

## Appendix C: Edification Script (Hot Handoff)

When transferring a qualified lead to a closer:

```
"You're in luck. You're actually going to speak with one of our
top experts on [topic]. He's been in this game for a while and
helped [similar businesses/people] achieve [thing they want].
We're fortunate to have him. He'll definitely be able to help
you with that.

Let me check his calendar really quickly. [pause]

[If moved time] Yep - I'm gonna slide you in so you can get
this taken care of ASAP.

[If same time] Yep - you're all confirmed and good to go.

The moment we get off the call, I'm going to introduce you
to him via text message. Does the [phone number] work?

Great. Alright. Have an amazing day, and enjoy your time
with [Closer Name]."
```

Then immediately:
1. Create 3-way text group
2. Introduce lead to closer
3. Include key qualification points
