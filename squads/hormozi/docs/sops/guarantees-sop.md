# Guarantees SOP

## Part 1: Purpose

Transform offers from ordinary to irresistible by reversing customer risk through strategic guarantee design. The Guarantee Strategy maximizes **conversions** by addressing the biggest objection to any product or service: the risk it won't work.

**Core Principle:**
```
The greatest objection to any product or service = RISK
Risk reversal = immediate way to make any offer more attractive

Impact: 2-4x conversion increase just by improving guarantee quality
Source: "Jason Fladlien... had seen the conversion on an offer go 2–4x
simply by changing the quality of the guarantee"
```

**Guarantee Power Formula:**
```
Guarantee = [Result X] + [Time Period Y] + [Consequence Z]

"If you don't get X result in Y time, we will do Z"

Without the "or what" portion = weak and diluted guarantee
```

**Business Impact:** A strong guarantee doesn't just increase sales - it typically increases NET sales even if refund rates rise.

### Guarantee Selection Decision Tree

```
START: What type of product/service?
│
├─► Consumable/Experience/One-time? → Consider ANTI-GUARANTEE with reason
│
├─► Revenue Share/Performance Model? → Use IMPLIED GUARANTEE
│
├─► High fulfillment cost? → Lean toward CONDITIONAL or ANTI-GUARANTEE
│
├─► Want maximum conversions? → Use UNCONDITIONAL
│
└─► Want maximum client results? → Use CONDITIONAL (tied to actions)
```

## Part 5: Process Steps

### PHASE I: GUARANTEE TYPE SELECTION

#### Step 1.1: Evaluate Product/Service Characteristics
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Analyze fulfillment costs, consumability, and measurability |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires business judgment |
| **Executor** | Human (business owner/marketer) |
| **Precondition** | Offer deliverables defined |
| **Output** | Product characteristic assessment |
| **Guardrails** | Consider all cost factors including time |
| **Decision Rule** | "If tremendous cost associated → lean conditional or anti-guarantee" |

**Key Questions:**
1. Is this consumable or does value diminish once given?
2. What are the hard costs of fulfillment?
3. Can results be objectively measured?
4. What actions must the customer take for success?

#### Step 1.2: Select Primary Guarantee Type
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Choose between Unconditional, Conditional, Anti, or Implied |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Product characteristics assessed |
| **Output** | Primary guarantee type selected |
| **Guardrails** | Consider customer type and their likely behavior |
| **Decision Rule** | "Match guarantee to business model and ideal customer profile" |

**Selection Criteria:**

**Unconditional if:**
- You want maximum conversions
- Product has low fulfillment cost
- You can absorb some refund increase

**Conditional if:**
- You want customers who do the work
- Results require customer action
- You want to reduce refund rate
- You have identifiable success factors

**Anti-Guarantee if:**
- Product is consumable
- You invest significant time/resources upfront
- Value diminishes once delivered
- Revenue share model in place

**Implied if:**
- Performance-based business model
- You only profit when they profit
- High transparency and trust required

### PHASE II: UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEES

#### Step 2.1: Design Unconditional Guarantee Structure
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create "no questions asked" refund offer |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Templates available |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Unconditional type selected |
| **Output** | Guarantee structure defined |
| **Guardrails** | Define clear timeframe and process |
| **Decision Rule** | "Keep it simple but powerful - remove all friction" |

**Unconditional Variants:**

| Variant | What Customer Gets | Risk Level | Use When |
|---------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| Total Refund | 100% money back | High | Default option |
| Partial Refund | 50% money back | Medium | Partial risk sharing |
| Ad Spend + Refund | Money + advertising costs | Very High | Maximum boldness |
| Competitor Payment | You pay for competitor's program | Extreme | Ultimate confidence |
| Premium Refund | Money back + additional amount | Extreme | "Better than nothing" offer |

#### Step 2.2: Craft Unconditional Guarantee Script
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Write compelling guarantee presentation |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity + Persuasion |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires copywriting skill |
| **Executor** | Human (copywriter) |
| **Precondition** | Structure defined |
| **Output** | Guarantee script/copy |
| **Guardrails** | Frame as "informed decision" not "yes/no decision" |
| **Decision Rule** | "Shift from asking for commitment to offering exploration" |

**Master Script (Jason Fladlien Framing):**
```
"I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today... I'm asking you to
make a fully informed decision, that's all. The only way to make a
fully informed decision is by being on the inside, not the outside.

So you get in and see if everything we say on this webinar is true
and valuable for you. Then, if it is, that's when you decide to keep it.

If it's not for you, no hard feelings. You'll then, after signing up,
be able to make a fully informed decision that this is not for you.

But you can't make that decision right now for the same reason you
don't buy a house without first looking inside.

And know this... whether it's 29 minutes or 29 days from now... if you're
not happy, I'm not happy. For any reason, if you want your money back,
you can have it because I only want to keep your money if you're happy.

All you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell us 'give me my
money' and you'll have it, and fast—our support response times
average 61 minutes on a 24/7 basis.

You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you
have is real and I'm quite confident that when you sign up at the URL
you are getting exactly what you need to BENEFIT."
```

### PHASE III: CONDITIONAL GUARANTEES

#### Step 3.1: Identify Success Conditions
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Define actions customers must take to qualify for guarantee |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Customer success factors known |
| **Output** | Conditions list |
| **Guardrails** | Conditions must be reasonable and achievable |
| **Decision Rule** | "If 100% follow conditions, 100% should get results (ideally)" |

**Condition Categories:**
- Attendance (show up to all sessions)
- Completion (finish all modules/exercises)
- Implementation (do the homework)
- Timeframe (within X days/weeks)
- Engagement (participate in coaching calls)

#### Step 3.2: Design "Better Than Money Back" Outcome
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create guarantee outcome MORE valuable than simple refund |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity + Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Conditions defined |
| **Output** | Guarantee outcome package |
| **Guardrails** | Perceived value must exceed investment |
| **Decision Rule** | "Match investment psychologically with equal/greater commitment" |

**"Better Than Money Back" Options:**

| Option | Description | Source Quote |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Result Guarantee | Quantify specific outcome | "You'll get X new customers in Y days" |
| Work Until Done | Continue service until success | "We'll keep working until you get it" |
| Double Down | Increase promise if they fail | "If 10 clients in Month 1 fails, we'll do 20 in Month 2" |
| Extended Credit | Additional service at no cost | "6 extra months free if X doesn't happen" |
| Performance Pay | Only charge if success achieved | "You don't pay unless you get results" |
| Personal Completion | You personally finish the job | "I'll fly to your office and do it myself" |
| Third-Party Validation | Based on others noticing | "If your spouse doesn't notice X in Y time..." |

#### Step 3.3: Craft Conditional Guarantee Script
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Write guarantee with clear conditions and powerful outcome |
| **Cognitive Type** | Persuasion + Clarity |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Conditions and outcome defined |
| **Output** | Conditional guarantee script |
| **Guardrails** | Conditions must be crystal clear |
| **Decision Rule** | "Ambiguity kills trust - be specific" |

**Conditional Guarantee Templates:**

**"Result Specific" Template:**
```
"You will [RESULT] in [TIMEFRAME], or [CONSEQUENCE].

Guaranteed: At least X new customers in Y days. If you don't
get at least X new customers in Y days, we'll continue working
free until you do."
```

**"Work Until Done" Template:**
```
"If you do every part of this program for [TIMEFRAME] and don't
[RESULT], I'll [CONSEQUENCE].

If you make every part of this program for 90 days and don't add
at least $10,000/mo in recurring revenue to your business, I'll
pay your monthly fees until you do. Yes. You heard right. I'll
cover your costs until you have the money coming in... and we'll
keep working with you until it works at no additional cost."
```

**"Double Down" Template:**
```
"If [INITIAL PROMISE] doesn't happen, we'll [DOUBLED PROMISE].

If you don't get 10 clients in Month 1, we'll get you 20 clients
in the next 2 months."
```

**"Performance Pay" Template:**
```
"You owe nothing for our services unless you're DELIGHTEDLY
SATISFIED with the increase in leads and sales we create for you.

We guarantee to increase your sales by 20% in 20 days or you
owe nothing. Never pay us until and unless you make money first."
```

**"Personal Completion" Template:**
```
"If you do every part of this program for 90 days and don't
[RESULT]... I'll fly to your office and stay there working with
you every day until we have it set up.

Yes. You heard right. I'll fly to work with you free, in person,
in your office, for as long as it takes to make absolutely certain
you have your sales and profits increased... (or I shouldn't be
in business)."
```

**"Third-Party Validation" Template:**
```
"If your [THIRD PARTY] doesn't [NOTICE/RESULT] in [TIMEFRAME],
we'll [CONSEQUENCE].

If your spouse doesn't double take at you in 60 days, we'll pay
for the meal plan and training for you both for the next year."
```

### PHASE IV: ANTI-GUARANTEES

#### Step 4.1: Develop Strong "Reason Why"
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create compelling explanation for "all sales final" stance |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis + Persuasion |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Anti-guarantee type selected |
| **Output** | "Reason why" narrative |
| **Guardrails** | Must show genuine vulnerability or logical necessity |
| **Decision Rule** | "Consumer must think 'Yes, that makes sense'" |

**Anti-Guarantee Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Reason Why | Source Example |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Consumable Product | "Can't return used shoes" | "If you wanted to test some shoes, would you buy them, wear them for a week, then ask for a return? No." |
| Time Investment | "My time is irreplaceable" | "My time is the most valuable asset I have. And I'm going to invest my time and decades of experience in helping you..." |
| Revenue Share | "I invest first with no guarantee" | "Look, I don't charge anything up front. I make money only when you make money." |
| Education/Course | "Protects committed students" | "If you buy our course and decide you don't want to follow it or do the work, we lose money, but more importantly, it won't be fair to the students who are here working hard." |

#### Step 4.2: Craft Anti-Guarantee Script
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Write "all sales final" with powerful justification |
| **Cognitive Type** | Persuasion |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Reason why developed |
| **Output** | Anti-guarantee script |
| **Guardrails** | Pair with commitment extraction |
| **Decision Rule** | "Make them prove they deserve access" |

**Anti-Guarantee Templates:**

**Consumable/Experience Template:**
```
"If you wanted to test some shoes, would you buy them, wear them for
a week and then ask for a return? No. You wouldn't be able to return
them anyway after wearing them. It would be gross to return used shoes.

Well, our product is no different."
```

**Revenue Share Template:**
```
"Look, I don't charge anything up front. I make money only when you
make money. I'm going to invest my time and resources in you.

I just need you to be fully committed to making this work. Otherwise,
I'll lose time and money and you'll lose your big opportunity.

If you're not fully committed, we won't take you on as a client, period."
```

**Education Template:**
```
"I want to make sure you get results. For that reason, we don't offer
refunds.

If you buy our course and decide you don't want to follow it or don't
want to do the work, we lose money, but more importantly, it won't be
fair to the students who are here working hard.

They came here to get results in life and in business. And they're
who I owe responsibility to.

So again, final sales means final sales."
```

---

### PHASE V: IMPLIED GUARANTEES

#### Step 5.1: Design Performance-Based Structure
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create model where you only profit when client profits |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis + Design |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Business model supports performance basis |
| **Output** | Performance structure defined |
| **Guardrails** | Must have transparency to measure outcomes |
| **Decision Rule** | "Your interests must be 100% aligned with theirs" |

**Implied Guarantee Requirements:**
- Transparency to measure the outcome
- Trust (or control) that you'll be compensated when you perform
- Clear definition of "performance"
- Upside participation for exceptional results

#### Step 5.2: Craft Implied Guarantee Script
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Articulate the alignment of interests |
| **Cognitive Type** | Persuasion |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Performance structure defined |
| **Output** | Implied guarantee script |
| **Guardrails** | Make alignment crystal clear |
| **Decision Rule** | "Prospect must clearly see you can't win unless they win" |

**Implied Guarantee Template:**
```
"I charge exactly $0 for my services. You heard right. $0.

I don't want a penny from you. I only make money when you make money.
Period.

Plus, I only get a cut of profit, not gross revenue. That means if you
don't become more profitable, I don't make a thing.

It means I could come in, spend your money recklessly, increase your
sales, and not make anything. Although that's unlikely, I hope you see
where my interests are 100% aligned with yours.

I literally cannot make money unless you make money first.

Sure, it also means that if you make a lot of money, I make a lot
(which is true). But again, I only make if you make."
```

### PHASE VI: GUARANTEE STACKING

#### Step 6.1: Stack Multiple Guarantees
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Combine guarantee types for maximum impact |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Primary guarantee defined |
| **Output** | Stacked guarantee package |
| **Guardrails** | Each layer must add value without contradicting |
| **Decision Rule** | "More layers = more perceived protection" |

**Stacking Combinations:**

| Combination | Example | Source |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Unconditional + Conditional | "30-day no questions asked PLUS 3x money back in 90 days if you follow X" | Ch.15 "Stacking Guarantees" |
| Conditional + Conditional | "$10k in 60 days, $30k in 90 days, if you do things 1, 2, 3" | Ch.15 "Stacking Guarantees" |
| Anti-Guarantee + Condition + Bonus | "All sales final because [reason], IF [commitment], I'll [bonus]" | Ch.15 "Stacking Guarantees" |

**Stacking Script Framework:**
```
"If you sign up today, you get...

[LAYER 1 - UNCONDITIONAL]
My unconditional 90-day no-questions-asked guarantee...

[LAYER 2 - CONDITIONAL]
PLUS, if you don't add $10k/mo to your business by the end of my
program—assuming you complete every module in 90 days—I'll write
all your sales copy for a year (value $50,000)."
```

#### Step 6.2: Combine Guarantees with Bonuses
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Integrate guarantee into bonus stack |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Guarantee and bonuses defined |
| **Output** | Integrated guarantee-bonus offer |
| **Guardrails** | Bonus must enhance guarantee, not confuse |
| **Decision Rule** | "Guarantee failure = bonus activation" |

---

### PHASE VII: GUARANTEE NAMING & PRESENTATION

#### Step 7.1: Name Your Guarantee Creatively
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create memorable name for guarantee |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Guarantee structure complete |
| **Output** | Named guarantee |
| **Guardrails** | Name must be memorable, vivid, unique |
| **Decision Rule** | "If using 'satisfaction'—you failed. Make it visceral." |

**Naming Examples:**

| Generic (Bad) | Creative (Good) | Creative (Great) |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| "30-Day Money Back Guarantee" | "Jump Into Shark-Infested Waters Guarantee" | "Club a Baby Seal Guarantee" |
| "Satisfaction Guarantee" | "I'll Cover Your Competitor's Program Guarantee" | "3X Your Investment Back Guarantee" |
| "Risk-Free Trial" | "Work Until It Works Guarantee" | "I'll Fly To Your Office Guarantee" |

**Creative Naming Framework:**
```
Instead of: "30-Day Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee"

Try: "In 30 days, if you wouldn't jump into shark-infested waters
to recover our product, we'll return every dollar you paid."

Or: "You get our famous 'Club A Baby Seal Guarantee.' After 30
days using our services, if you wouldn't club a baby seal to
continue as a customer, you don't pay a penny."
```

## Part 6: Decision Rules

### DR-001: Guarantee Type Selection
```yaml
rule: GUARANTEE_TYPE
trigger: Designing new offer
condition:
  - IF consumable_product == true THEN "ANTI or CONDITIONAL"
  - IF high_fulfillment_cost == true THEN "CONDITIONAL or ANTI"
  - IF revenue_share_model == true THEN "IMPLIED + ANTI"
  - IF maximum_conversions_priority THEN "UNCONDITIONAL"
  - IF maximum_client_results_priority THEN "CONDITIONAL"
action: Select guarantee type based on business model
confidence: HIGH
source: "Ch.15 Pro Tip: High Cost Services Warning"
```

### DR-002: Refund Math Validation
```yaml
rule: REFUND_ECONOMICS
trigger: Evaluating guarantee impact
calculation: |
  Net Impact = (New_Conversions × (1 - New_Refund_Rate)) /
               (Old_Conversions × (1 - Old_Refund_Rate))

  Example:
  - Before: 100 sales, 5% refund = 95 net
  - After: 130 sales, 10% refund = 117 net
  - Net Impact: 117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)
condition:
  - IF net_impact > 1.0 THEN "GUARANTEE PROFITABLE"
  - IF net_impact < 1.0 THEN "REVIEW GUARANTEE STRENGTH"
action: Always run the math, don't be emotional
confidence: HIGH
source: "Ch.15 'But won't people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?'"
```

### DR-003: Conditional Threshold Setting
```yaml
rule: CONDITION_CALIBRATION
trigger: Setting conditional guarantee thresholds
condition:
  - IF <80% of compliant customers would hit threshold THEN "THRESHOLD TOO HIGH"
  - IF 100% of compliant customers hit threshold THEN "OPTIMAL"
action: Set threshold so compliant customers achieve it
confidence: HIGH
source: "Ch.15 'Ideally, 100% of your customers would qualify for a
        conditional guarantee, but will have achieved their outcome'"
```

### DR-004: Client Quality Warning
```yaml
rule: GUARANTEE_BUYER_QUALITY
trigger: Strong unconditional guarantee in place
warning: |
  "People who buy because of guarantees can become very bad customers.
  A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may
  not be willing to do the work required."
action: Consider conditional elements tied to success actions
confidence: HIGH
source: "Ch.15 Caveat section"
```

### DR-005: Anti-Guarantee Reasoning
```yaml
rule: ANTI_REASON_VALIDITY
trigger: Using anti-guarantee
condition:
  - IF reason_shows_vulnerability == true THEN "VALID"
  - IF consumer_would_immediately_understand == true THEN "VALID"
  - IF reason == "just because" THEN "INVALID - needs rework"
action: Develop compelling reason why
confidence: HIGH
source: "Ch.15 'You should create a 'creative reason why' sales are final'"
```

### DR-006: Guarantee Stack Value
```yaml
rule: STACK_VALUE_CHECK
trigger: Stacking multiple guarantees
condition:
  - IF each_layer_adds_unique_protection THEN "VALID STACK"
  - IF layers_contradict THEN "INVALID - simplify"
  - IF layers_confuse_prospect THEN "INVALID - clarify"
action: Each layer must enhance, not dilute
confidence: MEDIUM [INFERRED]
```

---

## Part 7: Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: Culture of Entitlement
**Trigger:** Refund rate exceeds conversion lift
**Source:** "As consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability"
**Action:**
- Shift to conditional guarantee tied to completion
- Add friction to refund process (not eliminate guarantee)
- Consider implied or anti-guarantee for certain segments

### Exception 2: High-Cost Fulfillment
**Trigger:** Significant costs incurred upon delivery
**Source:** "If you have a tremendous amount of cost associated with your product or service"
**Response:**
- "You will probably want to employ a conditional guarantee or an ANTI guarantee"
- "You will have to swallow the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling"

### Exception 3: Refund Requestor Who Qualified
**Trigger:** Customer met conditions but still wants refund
**Source:** "If given the option of getting a refund or getting the result that was promised"
**Response:**
- "The vast majority of people will take the result"
- Offer to "double down" on the promise instead
- Example: "If they didn't get 10 clients in Month 1, offer 20 clients in Month 2"

### Exception 4: One-Time Value Items
**Trigger:** Product value depletes upon delivery (events, consumables, experiences)
**Source:** "Items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given"
**Response:**
- Use anti-guarantee with strong "reason why"
- "If you wanted to test some shoes, would you buy them, wear them for a week and then ask for a return?"

## Appendix B: Script Library

### Unconditional Scripts

**The "Informed Decision" Frame:**
```
"I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today... I'm asking you to
make a fully informed decision, that's all."
```

**The "Inside vs Outside" Frame:**
```
"The only way to make a fully informed decision is by being on the
inside, not the outside."
```

**The "House Analogy" Frame:**
```
"You can't make that decision right now for the same reason you
don't buy a house without first looking inside."
```

### Conditional Scripts

**The "I'll Cover Your Costs" Script:**
```
"If you make every part of this program for 90 days and don't
[RESULT], I'll pay your monthly fees until you do."
```

**The "Double Down" Script:**
```
"If [INITIAL PROMISE] doesn't happen, we'll [DOUBLED PROMISE]."
```

### Anti-Guarantee Scripts

**The "Used Shoes" Analogy:**
```
"If you wanted to test some shoes, would you buy them, wear them
for a week and then ask for a return? No. It would be gross to
return used shoes. Well, our product is no different."
```

**The "Protecting Serious Students" Frame:**
```
"We don't offer refunds because it wouldn't be fair to the students
who are here working hard."
```

## Appendix C: Math Examples

### Conversion Lift Calculation

**Scenario 1: Guarantee Doubles Refunds but Increases Sales 30%**
```
Before Guarantee:
- 100 sales
- 5% refund rate
- Net: 95 sales

After Guarantee:
- 130 sales (+30%)
- 10% refund rate (doubled)
- Net: 117 sales

Result: 117/95 = 1.23x improvement (23% net increase)
```

**Scenario 2: Break-Even Analysis**
```
For guarantee NOT to be worth it:
- Sales increase must be 100% offset by refunds
- 5% absolute increase in sales needs 5% absolute increase in refunds

Example of bad guarantee:
- 5% sales increase
- Refund rate goes from 5% to 10% (5% absolute increase)
- Net change: ~0% (break-even)

This is rare - "for a guarantee not to be worth it, the increase
in sales would have to be 100% offset by people who refunded"
```
