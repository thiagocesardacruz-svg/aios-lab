# SOP: $100M Hooks Framework

> **Source:** $100M Playbook: Hooks + FRAMEWORK HOOKS - Alex Hormozi
> **Pattern:** SC-PE-001 (SOP Extraction Standard)
> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Extracted:** 2026-02-10
> **Cross-Reference:** See `goated-ads-sop.md` for ad creation process (hooks = 80% of ad effort)

## Part 1: Purpose

Double marketing results by mastering the first 5 seconds of any content, ad, or outreach. Hooks are the single variable that can instantly 5x, 10x, or 100x marketing performance without changing anything else.

**Core Insight:**
> "After you've written your headline, you've spent eighty cents of your advertising dollar." - David Ogilvy

**Business Impact:**
- Same content, same offer, same price - different hook = millions in difference (Dean Graziosi case)
- If 10 hours available for advertising, 8 hours should go to hooks
- The hook determines whether everything else matters or not

**The Dean Graziosi Proof:**
Larry King infomercial with ego-driven hook ("Tonight on Larry King, I'm here with my guest Dean Graziosi, a multi New York Times best seller...") = BOMBED. Same infomercial with audience-focused hook ("Have you ever in your adult life looked at yourself in the mirror and thought 'I should be further ahead by now?'") = Sold millions of books.

## Part 2: Scope

### When This SOP Applies
- Creating any content, ad, email, or outreach
- Optimizing existing content performance
- Testing and iterating on marketing assets
- Building hook libraries and swipe files

### When This SOP Does NOT Apply
- Post-hook content creation (body/meat) - see `goated-ads-sop.md` Part 6
- Landing page optimization (different discipline)
- Product/offer design (hooks sell attention, not products)

### Relationship to GOATed Ads SOP
```
GOATed Ads SOP = WHAT to do (full ad creation process)
Hooks SOP = HOW to do the 80% (deep dive into hook mastery)

Use Together:
1. This SOP for hook research, creation, testing
2. GOATed Ads SOP for assembling hooks into complete ads
```

## Part 3: Preconditions

| Precondition | Requirement | Validation |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Spreadsheet System | Master tracker with platform tabs | Name/Hook/Views/Link columns configured |
| Performance Data | Access to analytics on at least one platform | Can see views/engagement metrics |
| Competitor Access | Can view competitor content/ads | Ad Library access, social platforms |
| Recording Capability | Can produce content to test hooks | Camera, editing, or text platform |
| Testing Mindset | Willing to test 10x more than current | "Let the data do the teaching" committed |
| Time Allocation | 80% of content creation time for hooks | Calendar blocked |

### Red Flags - NOT Ready If:
- [ ] Believes creativity is more important than data
- [ ] Not willing to "copy" what works
- [ ] Only tests 1-2 variations per piece
- [ ] No system for tracking performance
- [ ] Emotionally attached to original ideas
- [ ] Thinks hooks are "just titles"

---

## Part 4: The Hook Framework

### Core Components

```
HOOK = Call Out + Condition for Value

Call Out = Makes prospect say "This is for me"
Condition for Value = Promise of reward IF they consume
```

### The Cocktail Party Effect

> "Imagine you're at a club. Lots of people are hooting and hollering. Loud music thumping. In all that noise, a single sound pierces through it all and you turn around. Wanna know the sound? Your name."

Hooks harness this neurological mechanism. Goal: cut through noise and grab involuntary attention.

### Two Hook Types

**1. Verbal Hooks (Words)**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Labels | Words your avatar identifies with | "Local business owners, I have a gift for you" |
| Questions (Yes) | Questions with obvious "yes" answer | "Would you pay $1,000 to have the business of your dreams in 30 days?" |
| Questions (Open) | Questions that create curiosity | "Which would you rather be?" |
| Conditionals | Scenarios leading to result/command | "If you're working all the time and your business isn't growing, you're working on the wrong sh*t" |
| Commands | Direct instructions | "Read this if you're tired of being broke" |
| Statements | Declarative assertions | "The smartest thing you can do today..." |
| Lists/Steps | Numbered items | "In this video I'm going to talk to you about the 28 ways to stay poor" |
| Narratives | Stories and anecdotes | "One day I was in the back and this old lady comes in and she was piss angry" |
| Exclamations | Strong emotion expressions | "Ahhhhh... This is the blueprint to becoming a millionaire" |

**2. Nonverbal Hooks (Visuals/Sounds)**

| Type | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Pattern Interrupt | Unexpected visual | Catching a banana, unusual setting |
| Sound Cue | Attention-grabbing audio | Dropped tray (embarrassment signal), champagne clink (announcement signal) |
| Movement | Kinetic attention grab | Fast action, sudden change |

**Best Practice:** Combine verbal + nonverbal hooks for maximum impact.

### Hook Distribution by Type (Based on 121 Best Performers)

| Type | Percentage |
|------|------------|
| Statements | 35% |
| Conditionals | 20% |
| Questions | 15% |
| Commands | 10% |
| Narratives | 10% |
| Lists | 5% |
| Labels | 3% |
| Exclamations | 2% |

## Part 5: Process Steps

### Phase 1: Hook Research (70-20-10 Framework)

#### Step 1.1: Core Winners Collection (70% of Effort)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Document and organize proven winning hooks from your own content and competitors |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis + Pattern Recognition |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Can automate data collection, human judges quality |
| **Executor** | Hybrid (Worker collects, Human curates) |
| **Precondition** | Spreadsheet system configured |
| **Output** | Core hooks library (50+ proven winners) |
| **Guardrails** | Only include hooks with verified performance data |
| **Decision Rule** | "70% of your effort goes to 'more of what works'" |

**Implementation:**
1. Create new spreadsheet with tabs for each platform
2. Add columns: Name, Hook, Views, Link, Type, Date
3. Review your top 10% performing content
4. Extract the exact hook (first sentence/visual)
5. Document with metrics
6. Review before every content creation session

**Sources (Priority Order):**
1. Your own winning hooks (highest priority)
2. Your high-performing organic content
3. Competitor ads saved in swipe album
4. Viral content in your space
5. Ad Libraries (lowest - can't verify performance)

#### Step 1.2: Emerging Hooks Research (20% of Effort)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Find promising hooks from adjacent niches to adapt |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis + Creativity |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires creative judgment |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Core library exists |
| **Output** | Adapted hooks from other niches (10-20) |
| **Guardrails** | Must have evidence of performance in original niche |
| **Decision Rule** | "Winner Adjacent - if it works there, test here" |

**Implementation:**
1. Subscribe to software tools showing outliers by platform
2. Search topics adjacent to yours
3. Screenshot outliers with high engagement
4. Create slide deck with screenshot + adaptation idea
5. Test adapted versions in your niche

#### Step 1.3: Experimental Hooks Creation (10% of Effort)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create completely new, untested hook concepts |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity + Risk-Taking |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | 70% and 20% buckets filled |
| **Output** | Experimental hooks (5-10) |
| **Guardrails** | Accept 90% failure rate; looking for breakthroughs |
| **Decision Rule** | "Big new ideas - risky but could lead to huge wins" |

---

### Phase 2: Hook Creation by Awareness Level

#### Step 2.1: Map Audience Awareness

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Determine which awareness levels to target |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires market judgment |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Know your audience segments |
| **Output** | Awareness level distribution plan |
| **Guardrails** | Don't concentrate 90% in "Most Aware" - spread out |
| **Decision Rule** | "When in doubt, go a little broader" |

**The 5 Awareness Levels (Eugene Schwartz):**

| Level | Name | Hook Type | Audience Size |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------|
| 5 | Most Aware | Offer-driven | Smallest (hottest) |
| 4 | Product-Aware | Proof-driven | Small |
| 3 | Solution-Aware | Promise-driven | Medium |
| 2 | Problem-Aware | Pain-driven | Large |
| 1 | Unaware | Curiosity-driven | Largest (coldest) |

#### Step 2.2: Create Hooks for Each Level

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Write hooks targeting each awareness level |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis + Writing |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - AI can draft, human refines |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Awareness distribution decided |
| **Output** | 50 hooks across awareness levels |
| **Guardrails** | Use templates, don't invent from scratch |
| **Decision Rule** | "The hook determines the content, not the other way around" |

**Templates by Level:**

**Level 5 - Most Aware (Offer):**
```
"50% off our best-selling [PRODUCT] until [DATE]"
"[PRODUCT]: New formula with 25% more [BENEFIT]"
"The best offer I've ever made"
"At last! It's finally here."
```

**Level 4 - Product-Aware (Proof):**
```
"Discover why 10,000 people chose [PRODUCT] last month"
"See how [PRODUCT] increased ROI 150% for 5 industries"
"$4,664 per month in recurring revenue... That's what Kyle... The last person on the leaderboard... Was able to build..."
"The rumors are true..."
```

**Level 3 - Solution-Aware (Promise):**
```
"The fastest way to [RESULT] - introducing [PRODUCT]"
"Double your sales in 6 months with our strategy"
"How to get ahead of 99% of people"
"How I made my first $100M"
```

**Level 2 - Problem-Aware (Pain):**
```
"Tired of [SPECIFIC PROBLEM]? There's a better way"
"Your site isn't selling? You might be missing these elements"
"If you're working all the time and your business isn't growing, you're working on the wrong sh*t"
"Business owners: Do you ever wonder if you're working on the wrong stuff?"
```

**Level 1 - Unaware (Curiosity):**
```
"The hidden danger in your routine costing you [$/time/health]"
"The unexpected way your business is losing $1000s/month"
"You guys want to hear something completely insane"
"On November 30th, 2022, the world changed forever."
```

### Phase 3: Hook Testing

#### Step 3.1: Volume Testing Setup

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Configure testing infrastructure for high volume |
| **Cognitive Type** | Technical Setup |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Platform access, tracking configured |
| **Output** | Testing system ready for 10x volume |
| **Guardrails** | Budget minimum: enough for statistically significant data |
| **Decision Rule** | "Record 10 hooks for every 1 piece of ad content" |

**Testing Ratios by Content Type:**
| Content Type | Hooks per Piece | Reason |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Paid Ads | 10 | Highest stakes, need most data |
| Short Content | Reuse winning tweets as shorts | Cross-platform validation |
| Long Content | 3-4 | Team picks best in post |
| Emails | Active split tests | Document winners separately |

#### Step 3.2: Execute Tests

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Run hooks through content/ads and collect data |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH (ad platforms automate distribution) |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Content created with hook variations |
| **Output** | Performance data for each hook |
| **Guardrails** | Same meat/CTA across hook tests to isolate variable |
| **Decision Rule** | "Let the data do the teaching" |

#### Step 3.3: Analyze and Iterate

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Rank hooks, identify patterns, update libraries |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis + Pattern Recognition |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Sufficient data collected |
| **Output** | Updated hook rankings, pattern insights |
| **Guardrails** | Top 10% replicate, Bottom 10% eliminate |
| **Decision Rule** | "No matter how bad your content is, some will be in the top 10%. Make more like that." |

**Weekly Iteration Cycle:**
```
1. Look at top 10% performers (top 5 hooks)
2. 70% of next batch: variations of those top 5
3. 20% of next batch: permutations (visual + word changes)
4. 10% of next batch: completely different hooks (new research)
```

### Phase 4: Hook Organization & Swipe File

#### Step 4.1: Maintain Swipe File

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Continuously collect and organize winning hooks |
| **Cognitive Type** | Curation |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Can auto-save, human organizes |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Phone album created, spreadsheet active |
| **Output** | Growing swipe file of proven hooks |
| **Guardrails** | Save immediately when you see good hooks - don't rely on memory |
| **Decision Rule** | "I have an album on my phone where I save them all" |

**Organization System:**
1. Phone: Album for screenshots of ads/content
2. Spreadsheet: Categorized by type, awareness level, performance
3. Review: Before every content creation session
