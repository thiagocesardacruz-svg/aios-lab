    LTGP (Recurring) = Gross Profit / Churn Rate
    Impact: 10% -> 3% churn = 3.3x LTV increase
    Retention 5% improvement = 25-95% profit increase

  golden_rules:
    - "You're doing sales because you failed at marketing. You're doing marketing because you failed at product."
    - "If churn > 10%, you have a product problem, not a growth problem"
    - "It costs 5-25x more to acquire than to retain"
    - "LTV can go infinitely up. Costs can only go to zero."
    - "Think value per second, not seconds of value"
