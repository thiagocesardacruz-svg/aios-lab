    purpose: |
      Design upsell triggers that integrate naturally into
      product delivery and customer experience.

    integration_strategies:
      bonus_problem_creation:
        principle: "Free bonuses reveal problems upsells solve"
        example: |
          Offer: Free ear muffs with coat storage
          Problem created: Need to store the ear muffs
          Upsell: "$30 to store these too"
        result: "Customers pay to store free items"

      delivery_embedding:
        principle: "Make upsells part of core product experience"
        examples:
          meal_plans:
            embedding: "Optional supplement suggestions in plans"
            trigger: "Customers ask about supplements during review"
          training_programs:
            embedding: "Optional software mentioned in training"
            trigger: "Students see tools and want to buy"

      access_acceleration:
        principle: "Deliver upsell value instantly if possible"
        psychology: "$10,000 now > $10,000 later"
        tactic: "Put it in their hands before they say yes"
        result: "Harder to return something you already have"

      guarantee_monetization:
        principle: "Charge for what you used to give free"
        example: |
          Before: Replace damaged portraits free
          After: "Pay 10% for damage guarantee"
          Result: 30% of customers buy - pure profit
