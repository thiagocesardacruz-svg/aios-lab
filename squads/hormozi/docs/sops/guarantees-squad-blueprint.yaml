squad:
  name: guarantees
  purpose: "Transform offers from ordinary to irresistible by reversing customer risk through strategic guarantee design"
  domain: offer-enhancement
  source_playbook: "$100M Offers - Chapter 15: Guarantees"

  core_principle: |
    The biggest objection to any product or service = RISK
    Risk reversal = immediate way to make any offer more attractive
    Impact: 2-4x conversion increase by improving guarantee quality

  guarantee_formula: |
    Guarantee = [Result X] + [Time Period Y] + [Consequence Z]
    "If you don't get X result in Y time, we will do Z"
    Without the "or what" portion = weak and diluted guarantee

    purpose: |
      Analyze product/service characteristics to determine optimal
      guarantee type and structure. Identify success factors and

    analysis_dimensions:
      consumability:
        question: "Does value deplete upon delivery?"
        impact: "High = Anti-Guarantee recommended"
        examples:
          consumable: ["Events", "Experiences", "Food", "Services rendered"]

      fulfillment_cost:
        question: "What are hard costs of delivery?"
        impact: "High cost = Conditional or Anti recommended"
        warning: "You have to swallow cost of refund AND cost of fulfilling"

      measurability:
        question: "Can results be objectively measured?"

    tier: tier_0
    icon: "📊"

    purpose: |
      Calculate the economics of guarantee strategies. Ensure net
      positive impact even if refund rates increase. Run the math,
      don't be emotional.

    core_calculation:
      formula: |
        Net Impact = (New_Conversions × (1 - New_Refund_Rate)) /
                     (Old_Conversions × (1 - Old_Refund_Rate))

      example:
        before:
          sales: 100
          refund_rate: 5%
          net_sales: 95
        after:
          sales: 130
          refund_rate: 10%
          net_sales: 117
        result: "117/95 = 1.23x (23% improvement)"

    break_even_analysis:
      principle: |
        "For a guarantee not to be worth it, the increase in sales
        would have to be 100% offset by people who refunded"
      example: |
        5% absolute sales increase needs 5% absolute refund increase
        to break even (which would be doubling refunds from 5% to 10%)

    warnings:
      - trigger: "Refund rate increase > Conversion lift"
        action: "Adjust guarantee strength or add conditions"

      - trigger: "Negative net impact projected"
        action: "Do not implement - revisit guarantee design"

        make a fully informed decision, that's all. The only way to make a
        fully informed decision is by being on the inside, not the outside.

        So you get in and see if everything we say on this webinar is true
        and valuable for you. Then, if it is, that's when you decide to keep it.

        If it's not for you, no hard feelings. You'll then, after signing up,
        be able to make a fully informed decision that this is not for you.

        But you can't make that decision right now for the same reason you
        don't buy a house without first looking inside.

        And know this... whether it's 29 minutes or 29 days from now... if you're
        not happy, I'm not happy. For any reason, if you want your money back,
        you can have it because I only want to keep your money if you're happy.

        All you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell us 'give me my
        money' and you'll have it, and fast—our support response times

        Normally, you're going to want to show a massive exposure or
        vulnerability on your part that a consumer could immediately
        understand and think 'Yeah, that makes sense.'"

      categories:

            "If you wanted to test some shoes, would you buy them, wear
            them for a week and then ask for a return? No. You wouldn't

            importantly, it won't be fair to the students who are here
            working hard. They came here to get results. And they're who
            I owe responsibility to. So again, final sales means final sales."

        It means I could come in, spend your money recklessly, increase
        your sales, and not make anything. Although that's unlikely,
        I hope you see where my interests are 100% aligned with yours.

        I literally cannot make money unless you make money first.

        Sure, it also means that if you make a lot of money, I make a lot
        (which is true). But again, I only make if you make."

      "This is my current business model when I enter a business.
      I don't charge anything. Zero. Nada. Zip. Zilch.

      It is an anti-guarantee on the front and an implied guarantee on
      the back end. If the business doesn't improve, I make no money. Simple."

          PLUS, a conditional triple your money back in 90 days if you
