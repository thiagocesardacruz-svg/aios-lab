# Bonuses SOP

## Part 1: Purpose

Transform the perceived value of your offer by strategically stacking bonuses that expand the price-value discrepancy until prospects feel compelled to buy. Bonuses increase the likelihood that people who would otherwise say no will say yes.

**Core Principle:**
```
A single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into
component parts and stacked as bonuses.

The discrepancy between price and value grows with each bonus until
it becomes "too good to refuse" - breaking the elastic holding the
prospect's wallet in their pocket.
```

**Business Impact:** Bonuses allow you to increase value delivered without cutting price. They put you in a position of strength and goodwill instead of weakness. Each bonus can also become a revenue stream through strategic partnerships.

### The Value Stacking Principle

From Chapter 14:
```
"Every infomercial continues with 'but wait... there's more!'
They wouldn't use these techniques unless they were effective,
as every second of airtime costs money and must be justified with ROI."
```

The psychological mechanism:
1. Anchor the price to the main offer
2. With each bonus, the price-value discrepancy grows
3. The prospect subconsciously believes: "If these are the bonuses, the main thing must be even MORE valuable"
4. Eventually the discrepancy becomes too large to resist

## Part 5: Process Steps

### PHASE I: BONUS CREATION

#### Step 1.1: Identify Bonus Candidates from Existing Assets
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Inventory all existing assets that could become bonuses |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis (asset evaluation) |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires creative assessment |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Business has been operating and creating content |
| **Output** | Bonus candidate inventory list |
| **Guardrails** | Must have high perceived value, low delivery cost |
| **Decision Rule** | "High Wow Factor - things you don't want someone to miss" |

**Asset Types to Inventory:**
- Workshops (recorded)
- Webinars (recorded)
- Events (recorded)
- Interviews (recorded)
- Checklists
- Templates
- Scripts
- Tools
- Calculators
- Swipe files

**From Source:** "Create the habit of recording every workshop, every webinar, every event, every interview and use them as additional bonuses."

#### Step 1.2: Create Tools Over Trainings
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Develop tools, checklists, and templates (not more training) |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis + Creation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires expertise |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Problems and solutions identified |
| **Output** | High-value, low-effort bonus assets |
| **Guardrails** | Tools > Training (lower effort perception = higher value) |
| **Decision Rule** | "Invest once, provide infinitely" |

**Value Hierarchy (from Value Equation):**
```
1. Tools & Checklists     → Lowest effort/sacrifice = HIGHEST VALUE
2. Templates & Scripts    → Low effort
3. Done-with-you support  → Medium effort
4. Training/courses       → Higher effort (less valuable as bonus)
```

**From Source:** "Tools and checklists are better than additional trainings (since effort and time are lower with the former, so value is higher. The value equation still reigns supreme)."

#### Step 1.3: Address Specific Obstacles with Each Bonus
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Map each bonus to a specific objection or obstacle |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment + Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Customer obstacles documented |
| **Output** | Obstacle-to-bonus mapping |
| **Guardrails** | Each bonus must prove a limiting belief incorrect |
| **Decision Rule** | "Solve the next problem before they encounter it" |

**Bonus Purpose Categories:**
1. Prove their limiting belief is incorrect
2. Solve the next logical problem they'll face
3. Remove a perceived obstacle to success
4. Make success seem more likely

**From Source:** "Each [bonus] should address a specific concern/obstacle in the prospects' minds about why they can't or won't have success (the bonus should prove that their belief is incorrect)."

#### Step 1.4: Determine What Should Be Bonus vs Core Offer
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Decide which deliverables to highlight as bonuses |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Full solution delivery mapped |
| **Output** | Core offer vs bonus categorization |
| **Guardrails** | Bonuses = high-impact but could be overlooked items |
| **Decision Rule** | "Short in duration, high in quality or value" |

**Criteria for Bonus Selection:**
- "Wow Factor" - something you don't want them to miss
- Distinct enough to stand alone
- Short duration but high quality
- Easy to overlook in the main package
- High perceived value but low delivery cost

**From Source:** "Often you have so much 'stuff' you'll be providing customers (good stuff) that valuable nuggets can get lost in the mix. You want to take the most distinct ones that can almost stand alone and highlight them."

---

### PHASE II: BONUS PRESENTATION

#### Step 2.1: Name Each Bonus with Benefit in Title
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create compelling names that communicate value |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Can use AI assistance |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Bonus content defined |
| **Output** | Benefit-driven bonus names |
| **Guardrails** | Name must include the outcome/benefit |
| **Decision Rule** | "Name sells the transformation, not the thing" |

**Naming Formula:**
```
[Outcome/Benefit] + [Descriptive Name]

Examples from Chapter 10:
- "Foolproof Budget Grocery System"
- "Finger-Lickin' Custom Meal Plan"
- "Live-It-Up-While-You-Slim-Down Eating Out System"
- "Never-Quit Accountability System"
```

**From Source:** "Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title."

#### Step 2.2: Explain How Bonus Relates to Their Problem
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Connect each bonus to a specific customer problem |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Problem list and bonus mapping complete |
| **Output** | Problem-bonus connection script |
| **Guardrails** | Must be relevant to their stated concern |
| **Decision Rule** | "If they can't see the connection, it has no value" |

**From Source:** "Tell them: a) How it relates to their problem."

#### Step 2.3: Explain What the Bonus Is
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Clearly describe the bonus deliverable |
| **Cognitive Type** | Communication |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Bonus content finalized |
| **Output** | Bonus description |
| **Guardrails** | Be specific about what they receive |
| **Decision Rule** | "Tangible > Abstract" |

**From Source:** "Tell them: b) What it is."

#### Step 2.4: Share Origin Story of the Bonus
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Tell how you discovered or created the bonus |
| **Cognitive Type** | Storytelling |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Authentic backstory exists |
| **Output** | Bonus origin story |
| **Guardrails** | Must be genuine and relatable |
| **Decision Rule** | "Origin story increases perceived value" |

**From Source:** "Tell them: c) How you discovered it, or what you had to go through to create it."

#### Step 2.5: Future Pace the Benefit
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Paint a vivid picture of life with the bonus benefits |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity + Persuasion |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Clear understanding of desired outcome |
| **Output** | Future pacing script |
| **Guardrails** | Must align with value equation pillars |
| **Decision Rule** | "Help them see themselves succeeding" |

**Value Equation Alignment:**
- Faster results
- Easier process
- Less effort/sacrifice required
- Greater likelihood of success

**From Source:** "Tell them: d) How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience: i) Faster, easier or less effort/sacrifice (value equation)."

#### Step 2.6: Provide Proof the Bonus Works
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Include evidence that the bonus delivers value |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis + Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Results data or testimonials exist |
| **Output** | Proof element (stat, testimonial, or personal result) |
| **Guardrails** | Must be credible and relevant |
| **Decision Rule** | "Statistics, customer results, or personal experience" |

**From Source:** "Provide some proof (can be a stat, a past client, or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable."

#### Step 2.7: Assign and Justify a Price
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Give each bonus a standalone price and justify it |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment + Communication |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Bonus value understood |
| **Output** | Bonus price with justification |
| **Guardrails** | Price must be believable but impressive |
| **Decision Rule** | "Bonus value should eclipse main offer value" |

**From Source:** "Always assign a price to them and justify it."

**Psychological Principle:** "The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer... subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses, right?"

---

### PHASE III: 1-ON-1 PRESENTATION STRATEGY

#### Step 3.1: Ask for the Sale First
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | In 1-on-1 sales, ask for the sale before revealing bonuses |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Value presentation complete |
| **Output** | Initial close attempt |
| **Guardrails** | Only for 1-on-1 selling, not group presentations |
| **Decision Rule** | "Ask first, bonus second" |

**From Source:** "When selling one-on-one, you ask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses."

#### Step 3.2: If Yes - Reveal Bonuses as Surprise
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | After they buy, inform them of bonuses they'll receive |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Sale completed |
| **Output** | "Wow" experience reinforcing their decision |
| **Guardrails** | Must feel like a genuine surprise/gift |
| **Decision Rule** | "Reinforce the buying decision" |

**From Source:** "If they say yes, then after they sign up, you let them know about the additional bonuses they'll be getting. This creates a wow experience and reinforces their decision to buy."

#### Step 3.3: If No - Match Bonus to Objection
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Present a bonus that addresses their specific obstacle |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment + Negotiation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Obstacle identified, matching bonus exists |
| **Output** | Targeted bonus offer |
| **Guardrails** | Bonus must directly address their concern |
| **Decision Rule** | "Agree, add bonus, ask 'Fair enough?'" |

**From Source:** "If the person doesn't buy after the first ask, then you present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, then ask again."

**Script Framework:**
```
1. Agree with their concern
2. Present the bonus that addresses it
3. Ask: "Fair enough?"
4. Leverage reciprocity - they feel obligated
```

**From Source:** "People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you."

#### Step 3.4: Never Discount - Add Bonuses Instead
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Use bonuses instead of price cuts to close deals |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Prospect asking for discount |
| **Output** | Bonus offer instead of price reduction |
| **Guardrails** | Never teach customers prices are negotiable |
| **Decision Rule** | "Strength and goodwill > Weakness" |

**From Source:** "Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. This teaches your clients that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and good will rather than weakness."

---

### PHASE IV: BONUS ENHANCEMENT

#### Step 4.1: Add Scarcity to Bonuses
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Make certain bonuses available only through this offer |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Exclusive bonuses identified |
| **Output** | Scarcity-enhanced bonus presentation |
| **Guardrails** | Scarcity must be genuine |
| **Decision Rule** | "Available nowhere else" |

**Scarcity Version 1:**
```
"Only people who sign up for program XYZ will have access to
my Bonuses #1, 2, 3 that are never for sale or available
anywhere else other than through this program."
```

**Scarcity Version 2:**
```
"I have 3 remaining tickets for my $5,000 virtual event,
if you buy this program, you can get one of the last 3
tickets as a bonus."
```

**From Source:** "You can further enhance the value of your bonuses by adding scarcity and urgency to the bonuses themselves (which puts this technique on steroids)."

#### Step 4.2: Add Urgency to Bonuses
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Make certain bonuses available only for immediate action |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Time-limited bonuses identified |
| **Output** | Urgency-enhanced bonus presentation |
| **Guardrails** | Urgency must be genuine |
| **Decision Rule** | "Reward the action-takers" |

**Urgency Script:**
```
"If you buy today, I will add the XYZ bonus which normally
costs $1,000, for free. And I'll do this because I want to
reward the action-takers."
```

**Key Distinction:**
- Scarcity = Not time-limited but only available through this program
- Urgency = Time-limited, buy TODAY or lose the bonus

**From Source:** "The first two examples are not time limited. They state that if you buy the program, you get things you normally wouldn't be able to get. The urgency bonus is about them buying today, and if they don't buy today, they lose out on those bonuses."

### PHASE V: ADVANCED - PARTNER BONUSES

#### Step 5.1: Identify Adjacent Businesses
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Find non-competing businesses serving your customers |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Customer journey mapped |
| **Output** | Partner prospect list |
| **Guardrails** | Must not be direct competitors |
| **Decision Rule** | "What's the next natural thing they'll want?" |

**From Source:** "You can get other businesses to give you their services and products as part of your bonuses in exchange for exposure to your clients for free."

**Pain Clinic Example from Source:**
- Massage therapist (1-2 free massages)
- Chiropractor (free adjustments)
- Low-inflammation food company (discounts)
- Braces and orthotics (discounts)
- Health club (free training session + pool access)
- Pharmacy (prescription discounts)

#### Step 5.2: Negotiate Partner Bonuses
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Secure free/discounted products from partners for your clients |
| **Cognitive Type** | Negotiation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Partners identified |
| **Output** | Partner bonus agreements |
| **Guardrails** | Win-win structure required |
| **Decision Rule** | "Free marketing for them, high value for you" |

**Pitch to Partners:**
```
"I'll give you free exposure to my best prospects - my paying
customers. In exchange, you provide [service/product] that I
can include in my offer. It's free marketing for you."
```

**From Source:** "Businesses will do this because you are giving their business free exposure to the highest quality prospects, your customers."

#### Step 5.3: Negotiate Referral Commissions
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Get paid for customers you send to partners |
| **Cognitive Type** | Negotiation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Partner relationship established |
| **Output** | Affiliate commission agreements |
| **Guardrails** | Must not compromise customer value |
| **Decision Rule** | "Bonuses become profit centers" |

**Commission Example from Source:**
```
Chiropractor: $100 per person sent
Food company: Free food for you
Orthotics: $100 per referral
Health club: $50 per signup or free membership
Pharmacy: $100 per person

$400 offer → $350 additional profit from partner commissions
```

**From Source:** "If you're keeping track, each of these bonuses can become revenue streams for you indirectly, by getting customers to say YES more easily, and directly because you can negotiate that each of these businesses can pay you for the people you send to them."

#### Step 5.4: Negotiate Group Discounts for Customers
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Get volume pricing your customers couldn't get alone |
| **Cognitive Type** | Negotiation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Customer volume known |
| **Output** | Exclusive discount agreements |
| **Guardrails** | Discount must be genuinely exclusive |
| **Decision Rule** | "Leverage collective buying power" |

**From Source:** "Negotiate a group discount and a commission for yourself... our customers... get 30% off our products, plus the sponsored athlete gets 40% of all net sales after the discount is applied."

**Triple Win Structure:**
1. Your customers get exclusive discount
2. Partners get new customers
3. You get commission on sales

#### Step 5.5: Stack Partner Bonuses into Grand Slam Offer
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Apply Grand Slam principles to each partner bonus |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Multiple partner bonuses secured |
| **Output** | Enhanced partner bonus presentation |
| **Guardrails** | Each bonus gets full value treatment |
| **Decision Rule** | "Justify entire price through bonuses alone" |

**From Source:** "If you really want to go bonkers, create a grand slam offer with these partner businesses using the same concepts in the book so that each of the bonuses becomes even more valuable than a simple commoditized service."

**Ultimate Result:** Partner bonuses alone justify the entire offer price, making the main offer feel "free."

INITIAL OUTREACH:

"Hi [Name], I run [your business] and we serve [description of
your customers]. I noticed you serve a similar audience with
[their product/service].

I'm reaching out because I think we could create a win-win
partnership. Here's the idea:

I'd like to include [their product/service] as a bonus in my
[your offer]. In exchange, you'd get free exposure to my best
prospects - my paying customers.

For you: Free marketing to qualified buyers
For my customers: Additional value they couldn't get elsewhere
For me: A more compelling offer

Would you be open to a quick call to explore this?"

---

COMMISSION DISCUSSION:

"This partnership has been working great. My customers love
[their product/service].

I wanted to discuss taking this to the next level. Since I'm
sending you qualified customers who are already primed to buy,
would you consider a referral arrangement?

Many of my partners offer [X%] commission or a flat fee of
[$X] per customer. This aligns our incentives even more -
I'll be even more motivated to send quality referrals your way.

What would work for you?"
```
