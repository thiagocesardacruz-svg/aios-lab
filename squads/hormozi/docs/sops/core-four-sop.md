# Core Four Lead Acquisition SOP

> **Source:** $100M Leads - Alex Hormozi (Sections II-III)
> **Pattern:** SC-PE-001 (SOP Extraction Standard)
> **Version:** 1.0.0

## Part 1: Purpose

The Core Four are the **only four ways** a single person can advertise - let other people know about the things they sell. Master any one of these methods and you will never starve. Master all four and you build a $100M lead machine.

**Core Equation:**
```
Advertising = Making Known
Leads = People You Can Contact
Engaged Leads = People Who Show Interest In Your Stuff

More Advertising → More Engaged Leads → More Customers → More Money
```

**The Core Four Matrix:**

| | Warm (Know You) | Cold (Strangers) |
|---|-----------------|------------------|
| **1-to-1 (Private)** | #1 Warm Outreach | #3 Cold Outreach |
| **1-to-many (Public)** | #2 Post Free Content | #4 Run Paid Ads |

**Business Impact:** "If you're not getting as many leads as you want, you are not doing the core four with enough skill or enough volume."

## Part 5: Process Steps

### #1 WARM OUTREACH

#### Purpose
Reach out one-on-one to people who already know you. The cheapest and easiest way to find people interested in what you sell.

#### Why It Works
- High trust (they know you)
- No cost (just time)
- Reliable (works every time)
- 20% response rate typical
- Can build $100k+ business with this alone

#### Step 1.1: Build Your List
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Export contacts from ALL sources: phone, email, social media |
| **Cognitive Type** | Perception (data gathering) |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Export tools available |
| **Executor** | Human (initial) → Worker (automation) |
| **Precondition** | Access to all contact platforms |
| **Output** | Master contact list with count |
| **Guardrails** | Include ALL contacts - don't pre-judge |
| **Decision Rule** | "Everyone knows someone. Your contacts are your first 1000 leads." |

**Sources to Export:**
- Phone contacts
- All email accounts (personal, work, old)
- Facebook friends
- Instagram followers
- LinkedIn connections
- Twitter/X followers
- Any other social platform
- Old Christmas card lists
- Business cards collected

#### Step 1.2: Choose a Platform
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Start with platform where you have most contacts |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Contact list counted by platform |
| **Output** | Priority platform selected |
| **Guardrails** | Will hit all platforms eventually |
| **Decision Rule** | "Start with most contacts, then move to second most, and so on" |

#### Step 1.3: Personalize Your Message
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Use something you know about the contact as reason to reach out |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity + Perception |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Must feel personal |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Contact info available |
| **Output** | Personalized opening message |
| **Guardrails** | Check social profiles for recent life events |
| **Decision Rule** | "Don't be weird. Pay your social dues." |

**Example Personalization:**
```
"I saw you just had a baby! Congratulations! How's the baby? How are you?"
```

#### Step 1.4: Reach Out - 100 Per Day
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Contact 100 people per day with personalized messages |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Personal touch required |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Messages personalized |
| **Output** | 100 outreaches completed |
| **Guardrails** | Three attempts per contact max (1/day for 3 days) |
| **Decision Rule** | "To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want." - Charlie Munger |

**Rule of 100:**
- Warm Outreach: 100 reach outs per day
- Do this for 100 days straight
- "Commit to the rule of 100 and you'll never go hungry again"

#### Step 1.5: Warm Them Up (A-C-A Framework)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | When they respond, build rapport using Acknowledge-Compliment-Ask |
| **Cognitive Type** | Social Intelligence |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Contact responded |
| **Output** | Rapport established, conversation guided |
| **Guardrails** | 3-4 exchanges before making offer |
| **Decision Rule** | "People love talking about themselves. Let them." |

**A-C-A Framework:**
- **A**cknowledge: Rephrase what they said in your own words (shows listening)
- **C**ompliment: Tie to a positive character trait
- **A**sk: Guide conversation toward your offer topic

**Example:**
```
"Two kids and you're an accountant... Wow! Supermom! So hardworking!
Managing a full-time career and two kids... Do you have time for yourself?"
```

#### Step 1.6: Invite Their Friends
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Ask if they know anyone who needs help (not if THEY need help) |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment + Negotiation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Rapport established |
| **Output** | Referral or self-identification |
| **Guardrails** | Don't ask them to buy - ask who they know |
| **Decision Rule** | "When you ask about someone else, they often identify themselves" |

**The Ask Script (Value Equation):**
```
"By the way, do you know anyone who is (describe their struggles)
looking for (dream outcome) in (time delay)?

I'm taking on five case studies for free because it's all I can
handle. I just want to get some testimonials for my service/product.

I help them (dream outcome) without (effort and sacrifice). It works.
I even guarantee people get (dream outcome) or I work with them until
they do.

I just had a girl named XXX work with me who (dream outcome) even
though she (describe the same struggle your contact has). I also
had another guy who (dream outcome) and it was his first time.

I'd just like more testimonials to show it works in different
scenarios. Does anyone you like come to mind?

...and if they say no... Haha, well... does anyone you hate come
to mind? (ha)"
```

#### Step 1.7: Make the Easiest Offer - FREE
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | First five clients should be free to build testimonials |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | N/A |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Someone shows interest |
| **Output** | Free client enrolled |
| **Guardrails** | Get commitments: use it, give feedback, leave review |
| **Decision Rule** | "Free clients make you money three ways: convert to paid, send referrals, give testimonials" |

**Free Client Script:**
```
"As I'm taking only five people, I can give all the attention you need
to get brag-worthy results. And I'll give everything for free, as long
as you promise:

1) Use it
2) Give me feedback and
3) Leave a killer review if you think it deserves it.

Does that sound fair?"
```

**Why Free First Five Works:**
1. Get reps and become comfortable making offers
2. You're probably terrible at first - people are more tolerant when free
3. Learn and improve from real feedback
4. Get reviews and testimonials for future marketing

#### Step 1.8: Start Over From the Top
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | After exhausting one platform, move to the next largest |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Current platform exhausted |
| **Output** | Next platform started |
| **Guardrails** | Track which contacts on which platform |
| **Decision Rule** | "1000 leads = 10 solid days of work = minimum 5 free clients" |

#### Step 1.9: Start Charging
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | When people start referring, start charging |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | N/A |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Referrals begin coming |
| **Output** | Paid clients |
| **Guardrails** | Increase price by 20% every five clients |
| **Decision Rule** | "Litmus test: Once people start referring, start charging" |

**Price Escalation:**
- First 5: Free
- Next 5: 80% off
- Next 5: 60% off
- Next 5: 40% off
- Next 5: 20% off
- Then: Full price
- Continue: Raise 20% every 5 until you find sweet spot

#### Step 1.10: Keep Your List Warm
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Give regular value to your list to keep them warm for future outreach |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Initial outreach complete |
| **Output** | Warm list maintained |
| **Guardrails** | Use "9-word email" to probe for interest |
| **Decision Rule** | "A warm list is a valuable asset - treat them well" |

**Dean Jackson's 9-Word Email:**
```
"Are you still looking for [4-word desire]?"

Examples:
- Are you still looking for... to buy your dream home?
- Are you still looking for... to get more sales leads?
- Are you still looking for... to tone your arms?
- Are you still looking for... to open an online store?
```

No images. No frills. No links. Just a question.

### #2 POST FREE CONTENT

#### Purpose
Say it once and reach everyone. Build a growing warm audience that compounds over time.

#### Why It Works
- One effort reaches many people
- Audience grows over time (compounds)
- Makes all other advertising more effective
- Free (just time)
- Shared content = free distribution

#### Key Insight
"What I didn't understand was - the content you create is not the asset that compounds - the audience is. So even though content may disappear over time, your audience keeps growing."

#### Step 2.1: Understand the Unit of Content
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Every piece of content must Hook, Retain, and Reward |
| **Cognitive Type** | Synthesis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Topic selected |
| **Output** | Content unit created |
| **Guardrails** | Must satisfy the reason they started consuming |
| **Decision Rule** | "There's no such thing as too long, only too boring" |

**The Unit of Content:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              THE UNIT OF CONTENT                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. HOOK      → Give them reason to notice          │
│                  (What % start consuming?)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. RETAIN    → Keep them consuming                 │
│                  (What % keep going?)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. REWARD    → Satisfy the reason they started     │
│                  (Did they get what was promised?)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Step 2.2: Create Great Hooks
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Choose topics, craft headlines, match format to platform |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Understand platform norms |
| **Output** | Attention-grabbing hook |
| **Guardrails** | Include 2+ headline elements |
| **Decision Rule** | "80 cents of your advertising dollar is in the headline" - David Ogilvy |

**Topic Sources (5 Categories):**
1. **Distant Past:** Important life lessons
2. **Recent Past:** Things you did/happened recently
3. **Present:** Ideas as they come to you
4. **Trends:** What's trending now
5. **Manufactured:** Create an experience, then share it

**Headline Elements (Include 2+):**
- **Recency:** As recent as possible
- **Relevance:** Personally significant to audience
- **Celebrity:** Includes prominent people
- **Proximity:** Close to home (geographically)
- **Conflict:** Opposing ideas or people
- **Unusual:** Weird, unique, rare, bizarre
- **Ongoing:** Stories still in progress

**Format Rule:** Match what performs well on the specific platform

#### Step 2.3: Retain With Curiosity
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Use lists, steps, and stories to embed unanswered questions |
| **Cognitive Type** | Structure |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Hook created |
| **Output** | Structured content that retains |
| **Guardrails** | Use cliffhangers and loops |
| **Decision Rule** | "People want to know what happens... next" |

**Three Retention Engines:**
1. **Lists:** Items presented one after another with a theme
   - "7 Ways I Invested $1000 That Paid Off"
   - "28 Ways to Go Broke"

2. **Steps:** Actions that occur in order to achieve a goal
   - "3 Steps to Create a Great Hook"
   - "The Morning Routine That Doubled My Productivity"

3. **Stories:** Events (real or imagined) with lessons/conclusions
   - "My journey from sleeping under a gym to a 5-star penthouse"

#### Step 2.4: Reward Completely
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Fully satisfy the promise made in the hook |
| **Cognitive Type** | Quality Control |
| **Automation Potential** | N/A |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Content retained audience |
| **Output** | Satisfied audience who shares |
| **Guardrails** | If they don't share, it wasn't good enough |
| **Decision Rule** | "The audience decides. If audience grows, you're doing well." |

**Test Questions:**
- Did you deliver on the hook's promise?
- Would someone share this?
- Would someone want more?

#### Step 2.5: Master the Give:Ask Ratio
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Give far more than you ask; let them ask first |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | N/A |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Creating regular content |
| **Output** | Growing audience with high trust |
| **Guardrails** | Minimum 3:1 give:ask ratio; ideally "give until they ask" |
| **Decision Rule** | "The moment you start asking for money is the moment you decide to slow your growth" |

**Ratio Benchmarks:**
- Mature platforms (TV, Facebook): ~4:1 give:ask (monetizing)
- Growing platforms: Much higher give ratio
- Recommended strategy: "Give give give... give give give... maybe ask"
- Best strategy: "Give until they ask"

#### Step 2.6: Make CTAs When Needed
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | If you must ask, use integrated or intermittent CTAs |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Enough goodwill deposited |
| **Output** | Leads generated without killing growth |
| **Guardrails** | Don't kill your golden goose |
| **Decision Rule** | "Give in public, ask in private" |

**Two CTA Strategies:**
1. **Integrated:** Brief ads within content (like podcast spots)
   - Keep ratio high (58 min value : 2 min ask)
   - Place after valuable moments or at end

2. **Intermittent:** Mostly pure give content, occasional ask content
   - 10 posts of give, 1 post of ask
   - Better for short-form platforms

#### Step 2.7: Scale Production
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Choose depth-first or breadth-first scaling approach |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Human → Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Consistent posting established |
| **Output** | Expanded reach |
| **Guardrails** | Don't sacrifice quality for quantity |
| **Decision Rule** | "The best day to start posting was the day you were born. The second best day is today." |

**Depth-First (Recommended for starters):**
1. Post on one platform
2. Post regularly
3. Maximize quality AND quantity on that platform
4. Add another platform while maintaining first
5. Repeat until all platforms maximized

**Breadth-First (For established businesses):**
1. Post on one platform
2. Post regularly
3. Add another platform (before maximizing first)
4. Continue until on all platforms
5. Then maximize all at once

### #3 COLD OUTREACH

#### Purpose
Reach out one-on-one to complete strangers. Scale warm outreach to people who don't know you yet.

#### Why It Works
- Unlimited pool of prospects
- Can be automated at scale
- Works while you sleep
- Lower response rate but higher volume compensates
- Combined with content = powerful

#### Key Differences From Warm Outreach
- Expect LOWER response rates (5-10% vs 20%)
- MUST use automation to scale
- Need stronger hooks (no existing relationship)
- Compliance/legal considerations
- Volume makes up for lower conversion

#### Step 3.1: Build Your Target List
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create lists of people who fit your ideal customer profile |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis + Research |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker → Human validation |
| **Precondition** | Ideal customer profile defined |
| **Output** | Targeted contact list |
| **Guardrails** | Quality > quantity; verify accuracy |
| **Decision Rule** | "The right list is more important than the perfect message" |

**List Building Methods:**
- Purchased lists
- Scraped data (LinkedIn, directories)
- Industry databases
- Conference attendee lists
- Association member lists
- Social media searches

#### Step 3.2: Craft Your Cold Message
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Create message that earns attention from strangers |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW (template creation) → HIGH (sending) |
| **Executor** | Human (create) → Worker (send) |
| **Precondition** | Target list ready |
| **Output** | Message template |
| **Guardrails** | Test multiple variations; track responses |
| **Decision Rule** | "Lead with value, not with pitch" |

**Cold Message Elements:**
- Relevance: Why you're contacting THEM specifically
- Value: What's in it for them
- Credibility: Why they should believe you
- CTA: Clear, low-friction next step

#### Step 3.3: Execute 100 Per Day With Automation
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Use automation tools to reach 100+ strangers daily |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker (automation) + Human (responses) |
| **Precondition** | Message and list ready |
| **Output** | 100+ outreaches per day |
| **Guardrails** | Follow platform rules; don't get banned |
| **Decision Rule** | "Expect lower response rates; use automation to compensate" |

**Rule of 100 - Cold Version:**
- 100 cold reach outs per day
- Email, text, DM, cold call, flyers
- Automation is essential at this volume
- Track response rates obsessively

#### Step 3.4: Convert Responses
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | When strangers respond, build rapport quickly |
| **Cognitive Type** | Social Intelligence |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Response received |
| **Output** | Qualified lead |
| **Guardrails** | Use A-C-A framework from warm outreach |
| **Decision Rule** | "A response from a stranger = treat like gold" |

### #4 PAID ADS

#### Purpose
Trade money for leads at scale. The fastest way to scale lead acquisition.

#### Why It Works
- Unlimited scale (limited only by budget)
- Speed (immediate leads)
- Predictable (know your CAC)
- Skills from content transfer here
- Can test rapidly

#### Key Insight
"Paid ads are all about ROI. You put in X dollars and get Y dollars back. Good enough is good enough - you just need to make it profitable enough to scale."

#### Step 4.1: Set Up Tracking First
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Configure tracking before spending a single dollar |
| **Cognitive Type** | Technical Setup |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Ad platform access |
| **Output** | Complete tracking setup |
| **Guardrails** | Cannot optimize what you cannot measure |
| **Decision Rule** | "Phase 1 is Track Money. If you don't track, you'll get cleaned out." |

**Three Phases of Paid Ads:**
1. **Track Money:** Set up tracking before spending
2. **Lose Money:** Test and learn (expect to lose more than you win)
3. **Print Money:** Scale winners aggressively

#### Step 4.2: Create Your Ads
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Apply content principles to paid format |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW (creation) → HIGH (distribution) |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Tracking configured |
| **Output** | Multiple ad variations |
| **Guardrails** | Best free content often makes best paid ads |
| **Decision Rule** | "Test 10 ads expecting 9 to fail. Scale the 1 that wins." |

**Ad Creation Checklist:**
- [ ] Platform selected (where audience is)
- [ ] Audience defined (who sees it)
- [ ] Messaging ready (Hook + Retain + Reward)
- [ ] Call to action (what to do next)
- [ ] Budget set (what you're willing to lose)

#### Step 4.3: Budget Strategically
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Budget 2x your 30-day customer value per test |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Know customer value |
| **Output** | Testing budget set |
| **Guardrails** | If no leads at 1x 30-day value, turn off |
| **Decision Rule** | "2x 30-day profit to test; 1x 30-day profit cutoff if zero leads" |

**Budget Examples:**
- $100 profit in 30 days → Allow $200 per ad test
- Getting leads but losing? → Let it run to $200
- Zero leads? → Turn off at $100

#### Step 4.4: Measure LTGP:CAC
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Compare lifetime gross profit to customer acquisition cost |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Ads running, customers acquired |
| **Output** | LTGP:CAC ratio |
| **Guardrails** | Target >3:1; struggling companies usually <3:1 |
| **Decision Rule** | "If LTGP:CAC < 3:1, fix model or ads. If CAC > 3x industry average, fix ads. Otherwise, fix model." |

**LTGP (Lifetime Gross Profit):**
```
LTGP = Total Revenue from Customer - Total Cost to Deliver

Example:
- Customer pays $15/month
- Costs $5/month to deliver
- Gross profit = $10/month
- Customer stays 10 months
- LTGP = $100
```

#### Step 4.5: Achieve Customer-Financed Acquisition
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Structure offers so customers pay you back within 30 days |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | N/A |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Know your unit economics |
| **Output** | Breakeven in <30 days |
| **Guardrails** | Use upsells, cross-sells to accelerate payback |
| **Decision Rule** | "Cover CAC + delivery cost in first 30 days = infinite scale" |

**Customer-Financed Acquisition Example:**
```
Problem:
- CAC = $30
- First month profit = $10
- Breakeven = 3 months (cash flow problem)

Solution - Add Upsell:
- CAC = $30
- First month profit = $10
- Upsell ($100, 100% margin) accepted by 20% = $20 avg
- Total 30-day profit = $30
- Breakeven = Day 1 (unlimited scale)
```

#### Step 4.6: Scale Winners Aggressively
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | When ad is profitable, increase budget significantly |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Profitable ads identified |
| **Output** | Scaled ad spend |
| **Guardrails** | Add 20% to budget for efficiency loss at scale |
| **Decision Rule** | "If you had a machine that gave $10 for every $1, what would your budget be? All of it." |

**Scaling Budget Calculation:**
```
Budget = (Desired Customers × CAC) × 1.2

Example:
- Want 100 customers next month
- CAC = $100
- Base budget = $10,000
- Add 20% buffer = $12,000
- Daily budget = $400
```

## Part 6: Decision Rules

### DR-001: Method Selection
```yaml
rule: CORE_FOUR_SELECTION

condition:
  - IF more_time_than_money THEN start_with_warm_outreach()
  - IF more_money_than_time THEN start_with_cold_outreach_or_ads()
  - IF want_compound_growth THEN add_content()
  - IF already_doing_one_well THEN add_another_core_four()
action: Start with one, master it, then add more
confidence: HIGH
```

### DR-002: Warm Outreach Volume
```yaml
rule: WARM_OUTREACH_VOLUME
trigger: Daily warm outreach execution
condition:
  - IF daily_outreach < 100 THEN "INCREASE VOLUME"
  - IF daily_outreach >= 100 THEN "MAINTAIN"
action: Reach 100 people per day for 100 days
confidence: HIGH
```

### DR-003: Content Give:Ask Ratio
```yaml
rule: CONTENT_GIVE_ASK
trigger: Making CTAs in content
condition:
  - IF ratio < 3:1 THEN "SLOW DOWN ASKING"
  - IF ratio >= 4:1 THEN "SUSTAINABLE"
  - IF ratio == "give_until_they_ask" THEN "OPTIMAL GROWTH"
action: Default to giving; ask sparingly
confidence: HIGH
```

### DR-004: Paid Ads Budget
```yaml
rule: AD_BUDGET_TESTING
trigger: Testing new ad
condition:
  - IF zero_leads AND spend >= 1x_30day_profit THEN turn_off()
  - IF getting_leads AND spend < 2x_30day_profit THEN continue_testing()
  - IF profitable THEN scale_10x()
action: Kill losers fast, scale winners hard
confidence: HIGH
```

### DR-005: LTGP:CAC Health
```yaml
rule: LTGP_CAC_RATIO
trigger: Measuring ad efficiency
condition:
  - IF ratio < 3:1 THEN "WARNING - Fix model or ads"
  - IF ratio >= 3:1 THEN "SCALABLE"
  - IF cac > 3x_industry_average THEN "Fix ads first"
  - IF cac < 3x_industry_average THEN "Fix model first"
action: Diagnose root cause, then optimize
confidence: HIGH
```

### DR-006: Charging Threshold
```yaml
rule: START_CHARGING
trigger: Deciding when to charge
condition:
  - IF referrals_starting == true THEN start_charging()
  - IF no_referrals == true THEN keep_giving_free()
action: Referrals = permission to charge
confidence: HIGH
```

---

## Part 7: Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: No Contacts for Warm Outreach
**Trigger:** Claim to have zero contacts
**Response:** This is almost never true
**Actions:**
- Check ALL email accounts ever used
- Export phone contacts
- Review all social media platforms
- Look for old lists, business cards
**Minimum Expected:** 100-500 contacts minimum

### Exception 2: Can't Give Away Free
**Trigger:** People won't accept free offer
**Analysis:** Hidden costs are too high (time, effort, sacrifice)
**Response:** Ask "What would I have to do for it to be worth your while?"
**Lesson:** Use feedback to improve offer

### Exception 3: Ads Aren't Working
**Trigger:** Losing money on ads consistently
**Analysis:** Could be ads OR model
**Diagnostic:**
- If CAC > 3x industry average → Fix ads
- If CAC < 3x industry average → Fix model (LTGP too low)
**Key Insight:** "The cost to acquire customers is much closer between competitors than you'd think. The difference is how much they make from each customer."

### Exception 4: Content Isn't Growing Audience
**Trigger:** Posting but no growth
**Analysis:** Content not rewarding enough
**Response:**
- Review hook quality
- Check retention mechanics
- Ensure promise is being satisfied
- Look at what's working for others on platform
**Rule:** "If audience grows, you're doing well. If not, your stuff isn't that good yet."

## Appendix A: The Rule of 100

**The Core Commitment That Guarantees Results**

| Core Four Method | Rule of 100 Application |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Warm Outreach | 100 reach outs per day |
| Post Content | 100 minutes per day creating content |
| Cold Outreach | 100 reach outs per day (automated) |
| Paid Ads | 100 minutes per day working on ads |

**Duration:** 100 days straight

**Promise:** "If you do 100 primary actions per day, and do it for 100 days straight, you will get more engaged leads. Commit to the rule of 100 and you'll never go hungry again."

---

## Appendix B: More Better New Framework

### How to 10x Any Core Four Method

When you plateau with any method, apply this framework:

**1. MORE**
- Do more of what's already working
- Double your inputs → More outputs
- "Volume negates luck"

**2. BETTER**
- Test one thing per week per platform
- Focus on constraints (biggest drop-off points)
- Track results in a testing log

**3. NEW**
- New placements on same platform
- New platform with same approach
- New Core Four method entirely

**Priority Order:**
```
MORE (maximize volume)
→ BETTER (improve efficiency)
  → NEW PLACEMENTS (same platform, new spots)
    → NEW PLATFORMS (same method, new platform)
      → NEW CORE FOUR (add another method)
```

**Decision Point:** Only move to "new" when returns from "more" and "better" are lower than returns from "new"
