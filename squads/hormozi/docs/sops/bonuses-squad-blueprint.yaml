# Bonuses Squad Blueprint
# Pattern: HO-SB-001 (Hormozi Squad Blueprint Standard)
# Source: $100M Offers - Alex Hormozi (Chapters 10 & 14)
# Version: 1.0.0
# Generated: 2026-02-10

squad:
  name: bonuses
  purpose: "Stack bonuses that expand price-value discrepancy until prospects cannot refuse"
  domain: offer-creation
  source_playbook: "$100M Offers - Chapters 10 & 14"

  core_principle: |
    A single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into
    component parts and stacked as bonuses. Each bonus increases the
    discrepancy until it becomes "too good to refuse."
