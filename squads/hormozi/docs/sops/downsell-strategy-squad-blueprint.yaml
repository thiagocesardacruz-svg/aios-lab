# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

troubleshooting:
  - symptom: "Low downsell acceptance rate"
    possible_causes:
      - "Leading with downsell instead of main offer"
      - "Downsell not matching objection type"
      - "Terms too restrictive"
    diagnosis:
      - "Review objection classification accuracy"
      - "Check downsell sequencing"
      - "Compare terms to market"
    solutions:
      - "Always present main offer first"
      - "Match downsell process to objection type"
      - "Adjust terms based on acceptance data"

  - symptom: "Full payment ratio declining"
    possible_causes:
      - "Payment plans cannibalizing full payments"
      - "Too easy to get payment plan"
      - "Prepay discount not compelling"
    diagnosis:
      - "Compare before/after full payment %"
      - "Review step progression data"
      - "Survey full-pay vs plan customers"
    solutions:
      - "Increase prepay discount value"
