    purpose: |
      Maximize reach through multi-channel distribution.

      your ideal audience likes.

    association_transfer_mechanism:
      step_1: "Start with brand that means nothing (just a logo)"
      step_2: "Pair it with stuff your customers like"
      step_3: "Brand starts to mean 'thing customer likes' to them"
      step_4: "Add brand to generic product = premium branded product"
      step_5: "Customers want to associate with positively branded product"
      step_6: "They exchange money for premium product"

      Determine and execute market positioning moves to expand

      up_market:
        definition: "Target larger customers"
        example: "Multi-location assisted living owners"
        bouquet_shift: "Focus on problems larger players have"

      down_market:
        definition: "Target smaller customers"
        example: "At-home care and mobile assisted living"
        bouquet_shift: "Focus on problems smaller players have"

      adjacent:
        definition: "Similar but slightly different market"

        bouquet_shift: "Red roses to yellow roses"

      broader:
        definition: "Entire category"
        example: "All senior living (hospice, end of life, retirement)"

  pivot-executor:
    id: pivot-executor
    title: "Brand Pivot Specialist"
    tier: tier_2
    icon: "refresh-cw"

    purpose: |
      Execute brand pivots while ensuring positive net outcomes.
      "Only two things can happen: gain more than you lose,
      or lose more than you gain." (p.27)

    pivot_philosophy: |
      Bouquet Metaphor:
      - Individual elements = individual flowers
      - Assembled together = brand bouquet
      - What we include, from where, and how much = brand we create
      - Bad pairings = sticks and weeds (distort clarity)

    pivot_process:
      step_1: "Document current associations (bouquet inventory)"
      step_2: "Identify associations to add (new flowers)"
      step_3: "Identify associations to reduce (trim existing)"
      step_4: "Project audience impact (who gains, who loses)"
      step_5: "Execute if net positive expected"
      step_6: "Monitor actual results"
      step_7: "Adjust or revert based on data"

    net_change_rule: |
      "Losing audience is a part of life. You just wanna make sure
      you gain more than you lose. Don't let the five mean comments
      stop you from gaining the 500 new people who like the new thing." (p.28)

    case_studies:
      positive_pivot:
        example: "Small town band goes big"
        outcome: "Lost some locals, gained much larger audience"

      negative_pivot:
        example: "Pepsi Kendall Jenner ad"
        outcome: "More people hated it than liked it"

  recovery-specialist:

    title: "Brand Recovery Specialist"
    tier: tier_2
    icon: "shield"

    purpose: |
      Recover from branding mistakes by overwhelming bad pairings
      with good ones, never by elimination.

    recovery_philosophy: |
      "Most people's brands happen by accident... They take every podcast.
      They sell any customer. They talk about whatever's trending.
      And, surprisingly to them, no one has any idea what they're about." (p.28)

    mistake_impact: |
      "One bad pairing can absolutely hurt a brand. Just like one ugly
      flower messes up the whole bouquet." (p.29)

    recovery_strategy:
      principle: |
        "We don't try and eliminate the DUI, we don't try and eliminate
        the dead rose. It happened; there's nothing we can do about it.
        But what we try to do is to just overwhelm it with way more of
        the stuff that the majority of our people actually like." (p.29)

      execution:
        step_1: "Identify the bad pairing"
        step_2: "Assess damage scope"
        step_3: "Inventory positive associations available"
        step_4: "Create surge of positive content/associations"
        step_5: "Continue until bad pairing shrinks to irrelevance"

    case_study:
      name: "Kanye West"
      description: |
        "Kanye West... has said some things that people don't like,
        but he also comes out with products that people love. He made
        a Super Bowl ad, he sold shoes, he just came out with an album...
        over successive pairings the good stuff minimizes the bad stuff
        ...and people still buy." (p.30)

    tier: tier_2
    icon: "activity"

    purpose: |
      Monitor brand health across reach, influence, and direction.
      Evaluate pricing power as ultimate brand strength indicator.

        measurement: "Engagement rates, action rates, conversion"
        good: "High likelihood of behavior change"
        bad: "No behavior change"

      direction:
        definition: "How behavior changes - towards or away"
        measurement: "Sentiment analysis, purchase intent, referrals"
        good: "Towards (they like and buy)"
        bad: "Away (they hate and don't)"

    pricing_power_test: |
      Warren Buffett: "The single most important decision in evaluating
      a business is pricing power. If you've got the power to raise prices
      without losing business to a competitor, you've got a very good
      business. And if you have to have a prayer session before raising
      the price by 10%, then you've got a terrible business." (p.17)

    health_indicators:
      strong_brand:
        - "Can raise prices without losing business"
        - "Higher conversion than competitors"
        - "Customers don't consider competition"
        - "Word of mouth growing"
        - "Best talent wants to work for you"

      weak_brand:
        - "Need prayer session before price increase"
        - "Must compete on price"
        - "High churn to competitors"
        - "Negative word of mouth"
        - "Struggle to attract talent"

# ==============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ==============================================================================

troubleshooting:
  - symptom: "Audience growth but wrong type of people"
    cause: "Content/associations attracting non-ideal customers"
    example: "Hormozi attracting wantrepreneurs instead of business owners"
    solution:
      - "Recenter content around ideal customer"
      - "Prune associations that attract wrong audience"
      - "Accept some audience loss for quality"

  - symptom: "High reach, low influence"
    cause: "People know you but don't change behavior"
    solution:
      - "Deepen engagement with target niche"
      - "Strengthen emotional connection"
      - "Increase product quality/promise match"

  - symptom: "Competitor has 'cool factor' despite worse economics"
    cause: "Brand not delivering intangible value"
    example: "Hormozi supplements vs cool competitor"
    solution:
      - "Allocate budget specifically to brand building"
      - "Not just product/economics"
      - "Create associations that make people feel good"

  - symptom: "Bad publicity event"
    cause: "Single bad pairing damaging overall bouquet"
    solution:
      - "Don't try to eliminate or hide"
      - "Overwhelm with positive associations"
      - "Continue until bad pairing shrinks to irrelevance"

  - symptom: "Pricing pressure from competitors"
    cause: "Weak brand, commodity positioning"
    solution:
      - "Strengthen unique associations"
      - "Increase reach + influence"
      - "Deliver on promises consistently"

  - symptom: "Pivot resulted in net audience loss"
    cause: "Lost more than gained in repositioning"
    solution:
      - "Assess if loss is temporary vs permanent"
      - "Consider partial revert"
      - "Test smaller scope next time"

    "Wait five years and don't give up." (One Page Checklist, p.33)

    "Branding has higher returns than direct response advertising
    if you measure over a longer period of time." (p.30)

  milestones:
    month_1_6: "Foundation building, avatar clarity, initial content"
    month_6_12: "Reach building, association establishment"

    "There is no magic here. It's teaching people what you are about.
    And repeating it every day until the end of time. Because every day,
    you'll have people who just found you and have no idea who you are.
    And you have to serve them the same way you did your 'OGs.'" (p.31)
