## Part 1: Purpose

Capture revenue from customers who said NO to your main offer by adjusting offers to find the solution of highest value for their budget. Downselling transforms rejections into opportunities.

**Core Principle:**
```
"Any offer you make after someone says no is a downsell."
— Alex Hormozi, Seção 4

Downsells adjust the original offer to find the best value-budget match.
Two levers:
1. HOW they pay (payment plans, trials)
2. WHAT they get (quantity, quality, features)
```

**Business Impact:** Downsells can DOUBLE your closing rate. Example: 3/10 closes become 6/10 with proper downselling (35 on main offer + 40 on downsell from 100 leads).

---

### The 6 Rules of Downselling

| Rule | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | "They said no to THIS offer, not ALL offers" | p.17 - "Don't hide your head in the sand" |
| 2 | "Downsells are trades - if you give, you get" | p.19 - "Work with customer on give/take combinations" |
| 3 | "Personalize, don't pressure" | p.21 - "Discover what they like/dislike" |
| 4 | "Offer same thing in new ways" | p.23 - "100 ways to offer what you already have" |
| 5 | "Never lower price just to make someone buy" | p.25 - "That's discounting, not downselling" |
| 6 | "Customers talk about price" | p.27-28 - "If others got same thing cheaper, you'll upset people" |

---

## Part 5: Process Steps

### PROCESS I: PAYMENT PLAN DOWNSELLS

> "How much can you put down today?"

#### Step 1.1: Reward for Paying in Full
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Present full price with interest included, offer discount for prepay |
| **Cognitive Type** | Framing (anchor high, discount down) |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Price presentation templates |
| **Executor** | Human (sales conversation) |
| **Precondition** | Customer said no to main offer |
| **Output** | Either full payment or move to step 2 |
| **Guardrails** | Never present lower price first |
| **Decision Rule** | "It's $15, but it's $10 if you prepay. You save $5." Not "It's $10, but $15 if you pay over time." |

**Rationale:** Same math, better feel. Anchors at higher price, makes prepay feel like winning.

#### Step 1.2: Offer Third-Party Options
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Offer financing, credit card, or layaway options |
| **Cognitive Type** | Option presentation |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Can automate application |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Customer declined prepay discount |
| **Output** | Payment method selected or move to step 3 |
| **Guardrails** | Must have financing partner configured |
| **Decision Rule** | "Do you prefer I decide your payment terms or you decide?" |

**Three Options:**
- **Third-party financing:** Company pays you today, customer pays them over time (like car dealerships)
- **Credit card:** "Use a card, you get it today, pay the card company over time"
- **Layaway:** Pay before receiving - flexible terms, zero risk for you

#### Step 1.3: Offer Half Now, Half Later
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Split payment aligned with paycheck timing |
| **Cognitive Type** | Negotiation |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - Requires conversation |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Third-party options declined |
| **Output** | Payment scheduled or move to step 4 |
| **Guardrails** | Align with customer's pay schedule |
| **Decision Rule** | "When do you get paid? Let's put half today, half then." |

**Script:**
```
"When is the next time you get paid?"
"Do you want to put half today and the rest when you get paid?"
"What's the most you can put down today?"
"Great. Let's put that today and the rest when you get paid. Fair?"
```

#### Step 1.4: Check If They Still Want It
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Confirm desire before offering more payment options |
| **Cognitive Type** | Judgment |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Half payment declined |
| **Output** | Continue or pivot to different offer |
| **Guardrails** | If <8/10 desire, offer something else |
| **Decision Rule** | "On a scale of 1-10, how much do you want to do this?" |

**Decision Tree:**
- 8-10: Continue to step 5
- 7 or below: "You're right. We might have something more suitable for you." → Feature downsell

#### Step 1.5: Offer Three-Payment Split
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | One-third now, one-third each of next two paychecks |
| **Cognitive Type** | Arithmetic presentation |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Calculator |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Customer scored 8-10 desire |
| **Output** | Three-payment plan accepted or move to step 6 |
| **Guardrails** | Align with pay schedule (biweekly vs monthly) |
| **Decision Rule** | "Let's do a third now and a third on your next two paydays" |

#### Step 1.6: Offer Spread Payments Evenly
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Divide total across service duration |
| **Cognitive Type** | Math presentation |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Payment calculator |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Three-payment split declined |
| **Output** | Weekly/monthly payments accepted or move to step 7 |
| **Guardrails** | Match payment frequency to service delivery |
| **Decision Rule** | "16-week program? 16 weekly payments." |

**Example:** Gym Launch was 16 weeks, so offered 16 weekly payments.

#### Step 1.7: Offer Free Trial
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Transition to trial with penalty (Process II) |
| **Cognitive Type** | Offer pivot |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | All payment plans declined |
| **Output** | Trial enrollment or sale ends here |
| **Guardrails** | Must have trial structure ready |
| **Decision Rule** | "The sale ends here, at least for now." |

---

### PROCESS II: TRIAL COM PENALIDADE (PENALTY TRIAL)

> "If you do X, Y, Z, I'll let you start for free."

#### Step 2.1: Offer Trial Last
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Only offer trial after customer clearly rejected main offer |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategic sequencing |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Clear rejection of main and payment plan offers |
| **Output** | Trial offer presented |
| **Guardrails** | Never lead with trial |
| **Decision Rule** | "How about we start you for free? Would that work?" |

**Script:**
```
"Hmm, that's really a problem. Tell you what, how about we start you
for free? Would you be okay with that? We can just help you out and
if you like it, you can stay. Let me get your ID and we can start
the process. Fair? Great."
```

#### Step 2.2: Always Get a Card
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Capture credit card even for free trial |
| **Cognitive Type** | Process enforcement |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Form capture |
| **Executor** | Worker (form) + Human (conversation) |
| **Precondition** | Customer agrees to trial |
| **Output** | Card on file |
| **Guardrails** | If they refuse card = walk away |
| **Decision Rule** | "It's just how we've always done it." |

**Pro Tip:** If someone won't put a card down and commit to the work, don't sell to them. They complain more and convert less.

#### Step 2.3: Sell Staying and Paying
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Get commitment to continue after trial IF results |
| **Cognitive Type** | Future pacing |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Card captured |
| **Output** | Verbal commitment to continue |
| **Guardrails** | If they won't commit to staying, no point in trial |
| **Decision Rule** | "If this gets you results, will you stay long-term?" |

**Script:**
```
"I don't want you to just try, I want you to get results. And being
honest, you won't reach your long-term goals during this trial, but
you'll establish the habits to help you achieve them. And we'll help
you do that for free. But if you want your long-term results, you'll
have to continue after. I just want to make sure you're not looking
for a quick fix because ethically I can't promise that."
```

#### Step 2.4: Explain Fees After Getting Card
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Present penalty structure after card is secured |
| **Cognitive Type** | Terms presentation |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Document |
| **Executor** | Human (explain) + Worker (document) |
| **Precondition** | Card on file |
| **Output** | Terms acknowledged |
| **Guardrails** | Have customer initial fee clause separately |
| **Decision Rule** | Explain fees AFTER card, not before |

**Script:**
```
"We'll do our part as long as you do yours. That's fair, right? So
now I just ask you to bet on yourself. If you miss or skip anything,
your results will suffer. We charge to keep you on track. If you
mess up, no problem. You get charged a small fee, but it puts you
back on track. If you comply, you get all of this for free. So this
is the best way to get amazing results and keep it free for you.
Best of both worlds."
```

#### Step 2.5: Make Check-Ins Mandatory
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Build upsell opportunities into trial requirements |
| **Cognitive Type** | Structure design |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Calendar rules |
| **Executor** | Worker (scheduling) + Human (delivery) |
| **Precondition** | Terms acknowledged |
| **Output** | Check-ins scheduled |
| **Guardrails** | Charge fees for missed check-ins |
| **Decision Rule** | "Obviously, we charge if you miss these because it's the only way to get results." |

**Check-In Structure:**
```
"Yes, and you agree to attend each of these three check-ins:
First, we do X so that you can...
Second, we do Y so that you can...
Third, we do Z so that you can...
Obviously, we charge if you miss these because it's the only way
to get results."
```

---

### PROCESS III: FEATURE DOWNSELLS

> "Why don't we try this instead?"

#### Step 3.1: Downsell Quantity
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Offer less of the same product/service |
| **Cognitive Type** | Option reduction |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Pre-built packages |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Price objection identified |
| **Output** | Reduced quantity accepted or move to next step |
| **Guardrails** | Ensure reduced quantity still delivers value |
| **Decision Rule** | "Instead of 3-month supply, start with just 1?" |

**Examples:**
- Product: "Instead of three-month supply, how about we start with just one?"
- Service: "Instead of four sessions per month, why not start with two?"

#### Step 3.2: Downsell Quality
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Offer lower-tier version of product/service |
| **Cognitive Type** | Tier selection |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Tier menu |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Quantity downsell declined |
| **Output** | Lower tier accepted or move to next step |
| **Guardrails** | Maintain core value proposition |
| **Decision Rule** | "Instead of leather, we can do vinyl. Sound good?" |

**Quality Dimensions:**
- Time availability: Specific hours vs anytime
- Days: Mon/Wed/Fri vs any day
- Response speed: Overnight vs 5 minutes
- Delivery speed: Next week vs same day
- Ratio: 1-to-many vs 1-to-1
- Method: Text vs video call
- Provider: New employee vs owner
- Live vs recorded
- DIY vs Done-With-You vs Done-For-You
- Expiration: Limited time vs forever
- Customization: Generic vs personalized

#### Step 3.3: Remove Features Entirely
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Remove specific features to lower price |
| **Cognitive Type** | Subtraction presentation |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - Feature menu |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Quality downsell declined |
| **Output** | Feature-reduced package accepted or continue |
| **Guardrails** | Remove high-value features to highlight their worth |
| **Decision Rule** | "Instead of chat, email, AND calls, let's keep just chat and email, drop the calls." |

**Strategic Feature Removal (Guarantee Example):**
```
Before downsell: 25% close rate
After adding "remove guarantee" downsell: 75% close rate
- 35 buy main offer (with guarantee)
- 40 buy downsell (without guarantee)
Total: 3x the customers
```

**Key Insight:** Removing high-value features makes customers SEE the value and often choose to keep it at full price.

#### Step 3.4: Offer DIY Alternative
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Offer product/tools if they won't buy service |
| **Cognitive Type** | Category shift |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH - Product menu |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | All service downsells declined |
| **Output** | DIY product sold |
| **Guardrails** | Products should support same outcome |
| **Decision Rule** | "Can't afford chiropractic? Let me set you up with some home massage tools." |

**Examples:**
- Chiropractor → Foam rollers, massage tools, mats
- Painter → Rent spray machine, sell paint
- Alex Hormozi → "Instead of us buying your company, join a workshop"

```

---

## Part 7: Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: Customer Who Really Can't Pay
**Trigger:** Customer has genuine financial hardship
**Action:** Layaway option (pay before receiving)
**Rationale:** "They can take as long as they reasonably want to pay. But they only get the product after they've paid in full." (p.93)

### Exception 2: Customer Who Doesn't Do the Trial Work
**Trigger:** Trial customer not engaging
**Options:**
1. Charge penalty fees (as agreed)
2. Offer makeup opportunity
3. For non-starters: "A small fee isn't worth a one-star review. But hey, your choice." (p.186)

### Exception 3: Customers Talk About Prices
**Trigger:** Concern about different customers getting different prices
**Rule:** "Test prices with a specific number of people ahead of time. Don't charge less in the moment because you felt scared." (p.27-28)
**Action:** Set fixed prices and terms, don't negotiate in the moment

### Exception 4: Trial Customer Who Hates Experience
**Trigger:** Negative trial feedback
**Script:**
```
"Ask what they'd like different. Say you're right and you're
annoyed you missed that. Don't blame them. Only one person can
be angry and it needs to be you. Ask if they'll give you a chance
to make it right. Offer your higher-tier thing."
```
**Close rate on unhappy trials:** ~50% (p.185)

## Appendix A: Cultural Elements (Downsell Mindset)

### Core Mantras
| Mantra | Meaning | Application |

| "Downsells are trades" | Every give needs a get | Match value to price |
| "Personalize, don't pressure" | Find their fit | Discover preferences first |
| "100 offers, not 100 products" | Same thing, different ways | Maximize existing offerings |
| "Never just lower price" | Discounting kills trust | Always remove value too |
| "Customers talk" | Consistency matters | Same rules for everyone |

### The Car Salesman Anti-Pattern
```
WRONG: $5,000 → $3,000 → $1,000 → $400 for same insurance
RESULT: Customer said no to all AND questioned the car price

RIGHT: Different insurance at different prices
RESULT: Maintain trust, might close a sale
```

## Appendix C: Seesaw Downselling Script (Simplified Process)

For simpler situations or less experienced salespeople:

**Step 1: Frame payment plan as negative**
```
"Would you rather have giant monthly payments or small ones?"
[They say small]
"Normally it's X, and if you prepay today, you get a huge discount
and zero monthly payments. Does that work?"
```

**Step 2: If they can't prepay**
```
"The more you can put down now, the smaller your monthly payments.
If you can't pay upfront, I totally understand. Let's just adjust
the down payment until you get a monthly rate you like."
```

**Step 3: Make it collaborative**
```
"Pull your chair to their side of the table. Show them the options.
The sale becomes a team effort."
```
