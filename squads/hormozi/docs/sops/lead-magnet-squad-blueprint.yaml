    purpose: |
      Map the Problem-Solution Cycle for any business and identify
      the best narrow problems for lead magnets.

    methodology:
      step_1: "Document core offer (what broad problem it solves)"
      step_2: "List all steps/problems before that broad solution"
      step_3: "For each narrow problem, validate it reveals core offer problem"

      Real Estate Example (p.140-142):
      Core Offer: Help sell houses
      Narrow Problems: home value, increasing value, photos, cleaning,
      landscaping, repairs, moving, staging
      Each solves specific problem -> Reveals "still need to sell"
