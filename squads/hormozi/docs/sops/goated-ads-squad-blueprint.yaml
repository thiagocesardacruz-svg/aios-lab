squad:
  name: hormozi-ads
  purpose: "Create 150-750 ads per week using the GOATed Ads assembly process to scale paid advertising beyond the 'saturation ceiling'"
  extracted_from: "goated-ads-sop.md"

  philosophy: |
    "Six-Pack-Abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym. And like six-packs,
    ads are made in research, not in recording."
    - 80% time on hooks, 20% on meat, ~0% on CTAs
    - Volume is the secret to finding winners
    - Better ads = bigger audience converted
