## Part 1: Purpose

Get OTHER people to advertise for you. Transform your business from a solo lead-generation machine into a leveraged system where leads multiply through customers, employees, agencies, and affiliates.

**Core Principle:**
> "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum to place it, and I will move the world." - Archimedes

**Business Impact:**
- Exponential growth vs. linear (1 customer brings 2, 2 bring 4, 4 bring 8)
- Lower CAC (customers who come through referrals cost less or nothing)
- Higher LTGP (referrals buy more, pay upfront, stick longer)
- Business independence (growth continues without you advertising)

**The Four Lead Getters:**
```

## Part 2: Scope

### When This SOP Applies
- Business has paying customers
- Business needs to scale beyond personal advertising capacity
- Business wants leverage (more leads for less work)
- Business is ready to systematize growth

### When This SOP Does NOT Apply
- Pre-revenue startups (focus on Core Four first)
- Product not proven (referrals require goodwill)
- No capacity to handle more leads

### Four Leverage Scenarios (Source: Section IV Introduction, p.1-3)
| Scenario | Work | Leads | Leverage |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| #1: You alone | HIGH | LOW | LOW |
| #2: One lead getter | LOW | LOW | HIGH |
| #3: Many lead getters | HIGH | HIGH | HIGHER |
| #4: Lead getters who get lead getters | LOW | HIGH | HIGHEST |

**Target:** Scenario #4 - Build a machine where lead getters recruit more lead getters.

---

## Part 3: Preconditions

| Precondition | Requirement | Validation |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Product Quality | Product delivers results | Customers getting outcomes |
| Customer Base | At least some paying customers | List of contactable clients |
| Tracking System | Way to attribute referrals | CRM or tracking codes |
| Incentive Budget | CAC available to pay referrers | Budget allocated |
| Training Materials | Documentation for employees | Checklists created |
| Referral Infrastructure | Forms, links, tracking in place | Tech tested |

## Part 4: The Leverage Framework

### Four Types of Lead Getters

**Source:** Section IV Introduction, p.1-3

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      LEAD GETTER LEVERAGE HIERARCHY                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                                 │
│  Level 4: AFFILIATES (Other businesses promote to their audiences)             │
│     ↑                                                                           │
│  Level 3: AGENCIES (Businesses with services that get leads for you)           │
│     ↑                                                                           │
│  Level 2: EMPLOYEES (People in your business who get leads)                    │
│     ↑                                                                           │
│  Level 1: CUSTOMERS (Buy your stuff and tell others)                           │
│     ↑                                                                           │
│  Level 0: YOU (Do Core Four yourself)                                          │
│                                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight:** "Lead getters are not part of the core four because they're not things you do. You don't 'do' affiliates or 'do' customer referrals. But you have to do the core four to get them." (Source: p.2)

---

## Part 5: Process Steps

### SECTION I: CUSTOMER REFERRALS (Word of Mouth)

**Source:** Chapter "#1 Customer Referrals - Word of Mouth" (p.4-35)

> "The best source of new work is the work on your desk." - Charlie Munger

#### Step 1.1: Understand Referral Economics
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Calculate your referral baseline and growth potential |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - data collection automated, analysis human |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Access to customer data |
| **Output** | Referral vs. churn ratio |
| **Guardrails** | Compare monthly: referrals entering vs. customers leaving |
| **Decision Rule** | "If referrals > churn: you grow without other advertising" |

**Referral Growth Equation (Source: p.6):**
```
Referrals (entering) - Cancellations (leaving) = Net Growth

IF referrals > cancellations: You grow without other advertising (yay!)
IF referrals = cancellations: You need other advertising to grow (meh)
IF referrals < cancellations: You have to advertise just to break even (boo)
```

**Why Referrals Are Superior (Source: p.5-6):**
1. Higher LTGP (buy more expensive things, buy more often, pay upfront)
2. Lower CAC (free customers cost less than paid customers)

**Example Calculation (Source: p.5):**
- Normal LTGP:CAC = 4:1 (25% of profit goes to acquisition)
- With referrals (every customer brings 2 more): LTGP:CAC = 12:1 (8.3% of profit)

#### Step 1.2: Diagnose Why Referrals Aren't Happening
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Identify the root cause of low referrals |
| **Cognitive Type** | Diagnosis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - requires judgment |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Referral rate below target |
| **Output** | Root cause identification |
| **Guardrails** | Two main causes only |
| **Decision Rule** | "If product were exceptional, people would already know about it" |

**Two Reasons Businesses Don't Get Referrals (Source: p.7):**

**Problem #1: Product Not Good Enough**
> "If your product were exceptional, people would already know about it and you'd have more business than you could handle." (Source: p.7)

Questions to ask:
- "Why are my customers too embarrassed to tell everyone they know about my product?"
- Is it okay but non-remarkable (not worthy of remark)?

**Problem #2: Not Asking for Referrals**
> "Know why businesses have so few referrals compared to what they could have? They never ask for them." (Source: p.24)

**The Goodwill Formula (Source: p.8):**
```
Price = What you charge
Value = What they receive
Goodwill = Value - Price

More Goodwill → More Word of Mouth → More Referrals
```

#### Step 1.3: Build Goodwill (Six Ways to Give More Value)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Implement the six methods to increase perceived value |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategy + Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW - requires deep thinking |
| **Executor** | Human (strategy) → Hybrid (execution) |
| **Precondition** | Product exists |
| **Output** | Higher customer satisfaction and goodwill |
| **Guardrails** | Map to advertising framework (Call Out → Dream Outcome → etc.) |
| **Decision Rule** | "Increase value OR lower price - prefer value" |

**Six Ways to Get More Referrals by Giving More Value (Source: p.9-23):**

**1. Call Outs → Sell Better Customers (Source: p.9-10)**
- Find what your most successful customers have in common
- Use those similarities to target new audience with highest value potential
- Better customers → more goodwill → more referrals

Example: PR company found lowest churn customers were in specific niche seeking investor funding. Narrowed targeting = broke plateau, grew for first time in years, advertising costs dropped.

**Action Step:** "Figure out what your most successful customers have in common. Use those similarities to target a new audience that has the greatest chance of getting the most value."

**2. Dream Outcome → Set Better Expectations (Source: p.11)**
- Fastest, easiest, cheapest way to make product remarkable = exceed expectations
- You control expectations through what you promise

> "In the beginning, I would promise everything and more to get people to buy. Fulfilling that became a nightmare." (Source: p.11)

**Action Step:** "Slowly lower the promises you make when making offers. Keep lowering until your close rates decrease. At that point, stop."

**3. Increase Perceived Likelihood → Get Better Results for More People (Source: p.12-14)**

Six-step process:
1. Survey customers to find who got best results
2. Interview them to discover what they did different
3. Look at actions they had in common
4. Force new customers to repeat those actions
5. Measure improvement in average results (speed and outcome)
6. Match guarantee conditions to actions that get best results

Example (Gym Launch): Discovered that if gym owner ran paid ads and made a sale in first 7 days, their LTGP tripled. Focused all onboarding on hitting that milestone.

**4. Decrease Time Delay → Make Faster Wins (Source: p.15-17)**

Five ways to make wins feel faster:
1. Deliver seven small things at intervals instead of all at once
2. Share progress updates as frequently as possible
3. Force many wins in first 48 hours (forming impression window)
4. Always let them know when they'll hear from you next (BAMFAM)
5. Add 50% to deadlines to always deliver "early"

> "Customers form their lasting impression of a business in the first forty-eight hours after they buy." (Source: p.16)

**5. Decrease Effort & Sacrifice → Keep Improving Your Stuff (Source: p.18-20)**

Monthly improvement process:
1. Use customer service data, surveys, reviews to find most common problem
2. Figure out the fix (get feedback from customers who made it work despite problem)
3. Use feedback to improve product
4. Give new version to small group of struggling customers
5. Get feedback - if solved, launch to all; if not, back to step 2
6. Move to next most common problem, repeat forever

**Action Step:** "Set this as a recurring monthly process. Execute this process every month."

**6. Call to Action → Tell Them What to Buy Next (Source: p.21-22)**

> "If you have an incredible product, they're going to want more. You have to satisfy their desire to buy. If not, they will still buy... but from someone else." (Source: p.21)

- Keep selling to prevent customer drop-off
- More things to buy = more things to refer friends for
- Some customers who didn't refer for product A will refer for product B

#### Step 1.4: Ask for Referrals (Seven Methods)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Systematically request referrals using proven methods |
| **Cognitive Type** | Execution |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - process automated, asks human |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Goodwill built with customers |
| **Output** | Referral leads generated |
| **Guardrails** | Treat referral request as an OFFER |
| **Decision Rule** | "Asking for referrals only works when you treat it as an offer" |

**Key Insight (Source: p.24):**
> "Referrals come when you show the value the customer gets when they refer their friends."

**Seven Ways to Ask for Referrals (Source: p.25-32):**

**Method 1: One-Sided Referral Benefit (Source: p.25-26)**
- Pay your average CAC to either the referrer OR the friend
- Make them aware of the incentive
- Ask for real three-way introduction (call, text, or email - not just a name)
- Ask immediately when they buy, don't wait

Example: "$200 when your friend signs up" OR "$200 off for your friend"

*Spouse tip:* Works well for spouses since both benefit. Always ask for spouse, give family discount.

**Method 2: Two-Sided Referral Benefits (Source: p.26)**
- Pay CAC split between both parties (half to referrer, half to friend)
- Used by Dropbox (free storage to both) and PayPal ($10 credit to both)

Example: "$100 cash to you + $100 off for friend" - worked great for local businesses

**Method 3: Ask for Referral Right When They Buy (Source: p.27)**
- On sales contract or checkout page, ask for names/numbers
- Show them they get better results with a friend
- Best time to ask: moment of purchase (highest excitement)

Script example:
> "People who do our program with another person tend to get 3x the results. Who else could you do this program with?"

*Story:* New salesperson broke all records. Secret? "I just make sure to ask who else they'd like to come with them. Then I ask for an introduction."

**Method 4: Referrals as Negotiation Chip (Source: p.28)**
- Trade discount for introductions to friends
- Ethically charge different price because you changed the deal terms

Script:
> "I can't do anything less than $500 down payment, but if you make a three-way text introduction to some of your friends right now, I'll be happy to cut that initiation fee."

*If full-price customer finds out:* "Yes - Stacy got $100 off because she referred three friends. I'm happy to give you $100 if you refer me three friends. Who are you thinking of?"

**Method 5: Referral Events (Source: p.29)**
- Time-bound promotions (1-4 weeks)
- Points, credits, dollars, or bragging rights for bringing friends
- Sell the benefits of working with others

Event names:
- "Bring a Friend" promotion
- "Spouse Challenge" promotion
- "Accountability Partner" promotion
- "Coach Challenge" (create teams with employees and customers)

**Method 6: Ongoing Referral Programs (Source: p.30)**
- Talk about benefits of doing things with others ALL the time
- In free content, outreach, paid ads
- Friend saw 33% increase in total sign-ups after implementing (with 1M customers, 250k were referrals)

**Method 7: Unlockable Referral Bonuses (Source: p.31)**
- Create bonuses for people who 1) refer AND 2) leave testimonial
- Examples: VIP bonuses, courses, tokens, status, training, merchandise, service levels, premium support, additional hours

> "As always, the more insane you make the offer, the more people will refer. If you want them to refer, make it so good it'd be stupid not to."

#### Step 1.5: Advanced Referral Tactics
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Combine methods into sophisticated referral campaigns |
| **Cognitive Type** | Creativity + Strategy |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Basic referral system working |
| **Output** | High-conversion referral campaigns |
| **Guardrails** | Limited only by creativity |
| **Decision Rule** | "The only limit is your creativity" |

**Gift Card Strategy (Source: p.32-33):**
1. Give everyone a gift card worth 1/3 of program cost
2. They can give to a friend if friend signs up with them
3. Gift card has expiration date (7-14 days) to force action
4. Referrer gets status from giving (not selling)

Message reframe:
- Old: "Hey, join my program for $2000 off"
- New: "I got this $2000 gift card. You want it? I don't want to waste it."

*Enhancement:* Use three-way introduction. Send photo of gift card with friend's name written on it (personalized).

**Gift Card Sale (Source: p.33):**
- Sell gift cards at 90% off as gifts (for friends of customers only)
- Referrer "spends a lot" on friend, you get paid to acquire new customer
- Win-win-win scenario

### SECTION II: EMPLOYEES (Internal Lead Getters)

**Source:** Chapter "#2 Employees" (p.34-56)

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." - African Proverb

#### Step 2.1: Understand Why Employees Make You Rich
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Shift mindset on employee value proposition |
| **Cognitive Type** | Paradigm Shift |
| **Automation Potential** | N/A - mindset work |
| **Executor** | Human (leadership) |
| **Precondition** | Willing to examine beliefs |
| **Output** | New perspective on building team |
| **Guardrails** | Challenge existing beliefs |
| **Decision Rule** | "Replace yourself as fast as you can so you can become useful elsewhere" |

**Two Scenarios (Source: p.38-39):**

**Scenario 1:** $5M revenue, $2M profit, but business only works WITH you
- You have a well-paid job, not an asset
- Business worth nearly zero (no one else can run it)

**Scenario 2:** $5M revenue, $2M profit, business works WITHOUT you
- You have an asset, not a job
- Business worth $10M+ (investors would buy it)
- Plus: you get your time back

**Belief Shifts (Source: p.40-42):**

| Old Belief | New Belief |
|------------|------------|
| "If you want something done right, do it yourself" | "If you want something done right, get someone to spend all their time doing it" |
| "Nobody can do it like I do" | "If I can do it, someone else can do it better" |
| "No one can replace me" | "Everyone is replaceable, especially me" |

> "You get rich from what you earn. You become wealthy from what you own." (Source: p.39)

#### Step 2.2: Get Employees (The Internal Core Four)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Recruit employees using same methods as customer acquisition |
| **Cognitive Type** | Pattern Recognition |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Need to hire |
| **Output** | Candidate pipeline |
| **Guardrails** | Same volume and consistency as customer acquisition |
| **Decision Rule** | "The ways to get employee leads have equivalents to customer leads" |

**Internal Core Four (Source: p.45-46):**

| Customer Acquisition | Employee Acquisition |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Warm Outreach | Ask Your Network |
| Cold Outreach | Recruiting |
| Post Content | Post Job Openings |
| Paid Ads | Promote Job Openings |
| Customer Referrals | Employee Referrals |
| Affiliates | Associations, Guilds, Email Lists |
| Agencies | Recruiting Firms |
| Employees | Employees (unchanged) |

**Key Insight:** "When you need to get new talent, you just advertise to get it. And when you need more, you do more."

#### Step 2.3: Train Employees (The 3Ds Method)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Systematically transfer your skills to employees |
| **Cognitive Type** | Teaching/Transfer |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM - documentation automated, training human |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Employee hired |
| **Output** | Competent employee doing the work |
| **Guardrails** | Checklist-driven, not intuition-driven |
| **Decision Rule** | "If they're wrong or confused, WE were wrong or made it confusing" |

**The 3Ds (Source: p.48-51):**

**D1: DOCUMENT**
1. Write checklist of exact steps as you do them
2. Have trusted observers watch and document what you do
3. Record yourself doing the work multiple ways/times
4. Test checklist: Can YOU get A+ results following only the checklist?
5. First draft complete when checklist works for you

**D2: DEMONSTRATE**
1. Sit down and guide them through checklist step by step
2. If they stop or slow down to understand something, adjust checklist
3. Second draft ready for them to try

**D3: DUPLICATE**
1. They follow the same checklist you followed
2. You observe
3. If checklist is right, result will be the same
4. If they get wrong result following directions, fix the checklist
5. Make them follow it until they get it right

**Target Clarity:** "If you disappeared tomorrow, could a stranger get the results you get if they just followed your checklist?"

#### Step 2.4: Training Best Practices
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Apply training principles for maximum effectiveness |
| **Cognitive Type** | Coaching |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Training in progress |
| **Output** | Faster learning, better retention |
| **Guardrails** | Reward process, not just outcomes |
| **Decision Rule** | "Focus on ability to follow directions more than getting result right" |

**Training Principles (Source: p.51-54):**

1. **Ownership of errors:** "If they err or get confused, we erred or made it confusing"
2. **Simplicity test:** "If we have to explain what a step means, the step is too complicated"
3. **Competence vs. Performance:** They may know what to do but need practice (slow → smooth → fast)
4. **Reward following directions:** Even if result is wrong but directions followed = praise + fix checklist
5. **Immediate feedback:** Every success = let them know. Every error = pause, step back, try again.
6. **No punishment during training:** Learning is punishment enough
7. **One thing at a time:** Give one piece of feedback, practice until right, then next
8. **Retrain on drops:** Performance drops = they stopped doing important step (find it, reinforce it)

#### Step 2.5: Calculate Employee ROI
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Measure return on payroll investment for lead generation |
| **Cognitive Type** | Analysis |
| **Automation Potential** | HIGH |
| **Executor** | Worker |
| **Precondition** | Employees generating leads |
| **Output** | Cost per lead, CAC from employees |
| **Guardrails** | Include all payroll costs |
| **Decision Rule** | "LTGP:CAC should be at least 3:1" |

**Calculation (Source: p.55-56):**

```
Total Payroll / Total Engaged Leads = Cost per Engaged Lead
Cost per Engaged Lead × Leads per Customer = CAC
LTGP / CAC = Return Ratio

Example:
$100,000 payroll / 1,000 leads = $100 per engaged lead
$100 × 10 leads per customer = $1,000 CAC
$4,000 LTGP / $1,000 CAC = 4:1 ratio
```

**Acquisition.com Example (Source: p.56):**
- 30,000 engaged leads/month
- No paid ads, no outreach (just content)
- Team cost: ~$100,000/month
- Cost per engaged lead: $3.33
- Much higher revenue per lead than $3.33

#### Step 2.6: Diagnose Employee Issues
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Identify whether problem is advertising or sales |
| **Cognitive Type** | Diagnosis |
| **Automation Potential** | LOW |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | CAC above target |
| **Output** | Root cause identification |
| **Guardrails** | Ask the diagnostic question |
| **Decision Rule** | "Don't fire sales if you have advertising problem (and vice versa)" |

**Diagnostic Question (Source: p.57):**
> "Do my engaged leads have the problem I solve and the money to spend?"

| Answer | Problem Type | Solution |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| No | Advertising | Fix targeting, messaging, lead quality |
| Yes but not buying | Sales | Fix pitch, objections, closing |
| Yes but not enough | Advertising | Scale volume |

### SECTION III: AGENCIES (Outsourced Lead Getting)

**Source:** Section IV Introduction and brief mentions (p.3, p.46)

> "Agencies are businesses with services that get leads for you."

#### Step 3.1: Understand Agency Role
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Position agencies as shortcut, not dependency |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategic |
| **Automation Potential** | N/A |
| **Executor** | Human |
| **Precondition** | Need to scale faster than internal team allows |
| **Output** | Agency engagement strategy |
| **Guardrails** | Don't depend on them forever |
| **Decision Rule** | "Use agencies to learn, then internalize" |

**Key Principles [INFERRED from source context]:**
- Agencies do Core Four activities on your behalf
- Pay fees for their services
- Can shortcut your learning curve
- Goal: learn from them, eventually bring in-house or reduce dependency

---

### SECTION IV: AFFILIATES (Commission-Based Partners)

**Source:** Section IV Introduction and brief mentions (p.3, p.46)

> "Affiliates are businesses that tell their audiences about your stuff to get leads for you."

#### Step 4.1: Understand Affiliate Model
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Description** | Leverage other businesses' audiences for lead generation |
| **Cognitive Type** | Strategic |
| **Automation Potential** | MEDIUM |
| **Executor** | Hybrid |
| **Precondition** | Product that converts, tracking infrastructure |
| **Output** | Affiliate lead flow |
| **Guardrails** | Commission must be attractive but sustainable |
| **Decision Rule** | "Affiliates = other businesses promoting to their audiences" |

**Affiliate Recruiting (Source: p.46):**
| Customer Recruitment | Affiliate Recruitment |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Affiliates | Associations, Guilds, Email Lists etc. |

**Key Principles [INFERRED from source context]:**
- Pay commission on leads or sales generated
- Affiliates use their own Core Four to their audience
- You benefit from their audience without building it yourself
- Must have compelling offer and commission structure

## Part 7: Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: Full-Price Customer Discovers Discounted Referral
**Trigger:** Customer complains about seeing someone else get discount
**Source:** p.28
**Response:**
> "Yes - Stacy got $100 off because she referred three friends. I'm happy to give you $100 if you refer me three friends. Who are you thinking of?"

Result: They either back off OR give you three referrals. Win-win.

### Exception 2: Product Not Good Enough for Referrals
**Trigger:** Referral rate stays low despite asking
**Source:** p.7
**Response:** Stop focusing on referral tactics. Fix the product first.
> "If your product were exceptional, people would already know about it and you'd have more business than you could handle."

### Exception 3: Employee Seems Unteachable
**Trigger:** Employee keeps making mistakes
**Source:** p.51-52
**Response:** Before blaming employee:
1. Is the checklist clear enough?
2. Did we demonstrate properly?
3. Are we giving feedback one thing at a time?
4. Are they competent but need more practice?

### Exception 4: Referral Event Doesn't Generate Results
**Trigger:** Time-bound promotion produces few referrals
**Response:** [INFERRED]
1. Was the incentive compelling enough?
2. Did customers understand the value of doing things with others?
3. Was the deadline real and urgent?

## Appendix A: The One Question Test

**Source:** p.23

> "You lost all of your customers but one. The advertising gods banned you from doing the core four and declared:
> - All customers must come from this single customer
> - Violate our terms and we will destroy your business, and every other business you start, for eternity.
>
> How would you treat this customer? What would you do to make their experience so valuable they send all of their friends? What kind of results would they need to get? What would their onboarding look like? What kind of customer would you choose?"

**Application:** Act as if the advertising gods revoked your core four privileges at any moment. This mindset forces you to add more value to get more referrals.
