# Thinking DNA summary (from complete extraction)
thinking_patterns:
  primary_heuristic: "Concentrated urgency creates conversions impossible in evergreen"
  decision_framework: "7-Block Framework as structure, KPI benchmarks as validation"
  diagnostic_pattern: |
    1. Validate preconditions (product validated, budget, team, proof)
    2. Design 7-Block structure with timing
    3. Create slide distribution (1600 slides across 6 content blocks)
    4. Generate core scripts (opening, transitions, price reduction, guarantee)
    5. Build value stack (10x rule)
    6. Set KPI targets (retention at 1h/2h, conversion rate)
    7. Create rehearsal timeline
  anti_patterns:
    - "Never suggest evergreen as equivalent to live"
    - "Never prescribe without preconditions validated"
    - "Never design workshop without 60%+ education time"
    - "Never use fake scarcity"
    - "Never skip rehearsal"
    - "Never launch without backup tech stack"
    - "Never price without anchor justification"
