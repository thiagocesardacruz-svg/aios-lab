business_types:

  service_business:
    name: "Service Business"
    examples: ["Consulting", "Agency", "Professional Services", "Coaching"]

    typical_constraint: "Capacity (people)"

    scale_path:
      step_1: "Productize service offerings"
      step_2: "Hire to replicate delivery"
      step_3: "Specialize by niche or service"

    warning: "Quality at scale is the main challenge"

    key_metric: "Revenue per employee"
    target: ">$250k per employee"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Hiring before documenting processes"
      - "Taking any client regardless of fit"
      - "Founder staying in delivery too long"

  info_products:
    name: "Info-Products / Digital Products"
    examples: ["Courses", "Memberships", "Digital Downloads", "Coaching Programs"]

    typical_constraint: "Conversion or Delivery (getting results)"

    scale_path:
      step_1: "Improve offer using Value Equation"
      step_2: "Scale paid advertising"
      step_3: "Improve retention and completion rates"

    warning: "High churn if product does not deliver promised results"

    key_metric: "LTV:CAC ratio"
    target: ">3:1 before scaling ads"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Scaling ads before product delivers results"
      - "Ignoring completion rates"
      - "No community or support for students"

  agency:

    scale_path:
      step_1: "Build systems and SOPs"

      step_3: "Improve client selection (say no more)"

    warning: "Saying yes to wrong clients kills margins"

    key_metric: "Profit per client"
    target: ">30% gross margin per client"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Taking low-margin clients for revenue"
      - "No client qualification process"

  saas:
    name: "SaaS (Software as a Service)"
    examples: ["B2B Software", "B2C Apps", "Platforms", "Tools"]

    typical_constraint: "Acquisition vs Retention balance"

    scale_path:
      step_1: "Achieve negative churn (expansion > churn)"
      step_2: "Optimize activation and onboarding"
      step_3: "Scale acquisition channels"

    warning: "Scaling with high churn burns cash rapidly"

    key_metrics:
      - "MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)"
      - "Churn rate (<5% monthly)"
      - "LTV:CAC (>3:1)"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Scaling acquisition before fixing churn"
      - "No onboarding optimization"
      - "Feature bloat instead of core value"

  ecommerce:
    name: "E-commerce"
    examples: ["DTC Brands", "Dropshipping", "Amazon Sellers", "Retail"]

    typical_constraint: "Unit economics and CAC"

    scale_path:
      step_1: "Optimize LTV (AOV + repeat purchases)"
      step_2: "Reduce CAC through organic + brand"
      step_3: "Scale profitable ad spend"

    warning: "Cash cycle is critical - inventory ties up capital"

    key_metrics:
      - "ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)"
      - "AOV (Average Order Value)"
      - "LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)"
      - "Contribution margin per order"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Scaling unprofitable products"
      - "Ignoring repeat purchase rate"
      - "No email/SMS for retention"

decision_matrix:
  identify_business_type:
    question: "How do you deliver value?"
    options:
      - "Done-for-you service → Service Business or Agency"
      - "Done-with-you → Coaching/Info-product"
      - "Do-it-yourself digital → Info-product or SaaS"
      - "Physical product → E-commerce"
      - "Software access → SaaS"

  diagnose_constraint:
    service_agency:
      - "If calendar empty → Leads"
      - "If plenty of leads but not closing → Conversion"
      - "If closing but can't deliver → Capacity"

    info_product:
      - "If ads not converting → Offer or Targeting"
      - "If high refunds → Product quality"
      - "If high churn → Retention/results"

    saas:
      - "If high churn → Product/onboarding"
      - "If low conversion → Offer/positioning"
      - "If healthy metrics → Scale acquisition"

    ecommerce:
      - "If ROAS < 2 → Fix offer or creative"
      - "If no repeat purchases → Fix retention"
      - "If profitable but slow → Scale ad spend"
