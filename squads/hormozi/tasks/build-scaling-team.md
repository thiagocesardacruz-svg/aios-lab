## WHO Hiring Method

### Step 1: SCORECARD (Before interviewing)
```
- Mission: Why does this role exist?
- Outcomes: What must they achieve in 12 months?
- Competencies: What skills/behaviors required?
```

### Step 2: SOURCE (Find candidates)
```
Priority order:
1. Referrals from A-players (A's know A's)
2. Recruiters (for senior roles)
3. Job boards (last resort)
```

### Step 3: SELECT (4 Interview Framework)

**Interview 1: Screening (30 min)**
```
- What are you looking for?
- Walk me through your career
- Why did you leave each job?
```

**Interview 2: Top-grading (2-3 hours)**
```
For each job:
- What were you hired to do?
- What did you accomplish?
- What did you learn?
- Why did you leave?
```

**Interview 3: Focused (1 hour)**
```
- Deep dive on specific competencies
- Have them solve real problem
```

**Interview 4: Reference (30 min x 3-5 refs)**
```
- "What is the biggest thing they need to work on?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate them?"
- "Would you enthusiastically rehire them?"
```

### Step 4: SELL (Close the candidate)
```
The 5 F's:
- Fit: Show them the opportunity
- Family: Address concerns of loved ones
- Freedom: Explain autonomy they will have
- Fortune: Compensation + upside
- Fun: Culture and team
```

## Delegation Framework: 5 Levels

| Level | Name | For Who | Script | Freedom |
|-------|------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Do Exactly | New hires, critical tasks | "Do X, then Y, then Z. Report back." | None |
| 2 | Research & Report | Learning employees | "Research options, present 3 choices with recommendation" | Research only |
| 3 | Research & Recommend | Competent employees | "Research, recommend, wait for approval" | Recommendation |
| 4 | Decide & Inform | Trusted employees | "Make the decision, just let me know what you did" | Decision with notification |
| 5 | Full Ownership | A-players, senior leaders | "Own this completely. I trust your judgment." | Full autonomy |

**Progression Rule:** Start at Level 1, move up as trust is earned.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Determine Hiring Readiness
```
- What is your current revenue stage?

For the role you need:
- Write mission statement
- Define 3-5 outcomes for Year 1
- List required competencies
```

### Step 3: Source Candidates
```
1. Ask 5 A-players: "Who's the best [role] you know?"
2. Post in industry communities
3. Use recruiter if $150k+ role
```

### Step 4: Run 4-Interview Process
Follow WHO method for each candidate.

### Step 5: Onboard with 30-60-90
Create specific plan for the hire.

### Step 6: Set Delegation Level
Start at Level 1-2, progress based on performance.

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Hiring before documenting processes
❌ Hiring to solve a leads problem (hire only for capacity)
❌ Skipping reference checks
❌ Starting at Level 5 delegation
❌ No scorecard before interviewing
❌ Hiring B-players because "we need someone now"
