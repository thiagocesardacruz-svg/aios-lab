## Purpose
Design real scarcity and urgency elements that drive action without destroying trust.

> "Fake scarcity destroys trust permanently. Real scarcity drives action and respect." — Alex Hormozi

---

## The Core Rule

**Only use REAL scarcity and urgency.**

Fake deadlines, fake limits, and evergreen "last chance" emails destroy your reputation faster than they make sales.

---

## Types of Real Scarcity

### 1. Capacity Scarcity
You can only serve X people at a time.

```
"We accept 10 new clients per month because
each client gets 5 hours of personal attention."
```

**Proof:** Show your calendar, explain the math.

### 2. Time Scarcity
The opportunity actually ends.

```
"Registration closes Friday because the live
cohort starts Monday."
```

**Proof:** The event has a real start date.

### 3. Inventory Scarcity
There are literally limited units.

```
"I only produced 500 copies of this
implementation system."
```

**Proof:** Show the physical constraint.

### 4. Bonus Scarcity
The bonus actually goes away.

```
"The live Q&A bonus is only for people who
join this week because I can only do so many calls."
```

**Proof:** Calendar shows limited slots.

---

## Types of Real Urgency

### 1. Event-Based Urgency
Something is happening that creates a real deadline.

```
"The workshop is next Tuesday.
If you're not registered, you can't attend."
```

### 2. Price-Based Urgency
Price actually changes.

```
"Price increases from $997 to $1,497 on Monday.
This is permanent."
```

**Rule:** You must actually raise the price and keep it there.

### 3. Seasonal Urgency
Timing matters for the offer.

```
"This tax strategy only works if implemented
before December 31st."
```

### 4. Cohort-Based Urgency
Group starts on a specific date.

```
"The next cohort starts January 15th.
The one after that isn't until April."
```

## How to Create Real Scarcity

### Option 1: Build Business Model Around It
- Limit cohort sizes
- Create true capacity constraints
- Make bonuses time-limited by nature

### Option 2: Create Events
- Live workshops
- Group coaching with start dates
- Limited-time promotions

### Option 3: Actually Raise Prices
- Plan price increases
- Communicate them
- Never back down

---

## Scarcity Communication Templates

### Capacity Scarcity
```
"I can only take [X] new clients because [REASON].

We currently have [Y] spots remaining.

When they're gone, the next opening is [DATE/TIMEFRAME]."
```

### Deadline Urgency
```
"This offer ends [DATE] at [TIME].

After that, [WHAT HAPPENS]:
- Price increases to $[X]
- Bonus disappears
- Registration closes

I will not extend this deadline."
```

### Cohort Urgency
```
"The next group starts [DATE].

Everyone starts together so we can:
- [BENEFIT 1]
- [BENEFIT 2]

The following group won't start until [LATER DATE]."
```

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Identify Real Constraints
What actually limits your capacity or timing?

### Step 2: Design Offer Around Constraints
Build the constraint into the offer structure.

### Step 3: Document the Proof
How can you demonstrate it's real?

### Step 4: Communicate Clearly
State the scarcity/urgency directly.

### Step 5: Follow Through
Never extend. Never fake. Trust is everything.

## What NOT to Do

❌ Evergreen countdown timers that reset
❌ "Only 3 left!" that never changes
❌ Deadlines you extend when asked
❌ Fake limited editions that you keep producing
❌ Price increases you roll back
❌ "One-time offer" you show repeatedly
