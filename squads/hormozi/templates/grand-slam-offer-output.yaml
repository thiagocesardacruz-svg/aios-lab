  # SECTION 1: MARKET VALIDATION (Elicit from user)
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: market-validation
    title: "Phase 0 — Market Validation"
    instruction: |
      Before building the offer, validate the market. A Grand Slam Offer
      cannot save a bad market.

      Ask the user these questions (do NOT skip):
      1. What do you sell? (product/service description)
      2. Who do you sell it to? (specific avatar, not "everyone")
      3. What do you currently charge?
      4. How do you get customers today? (which of the Core Four)
      5. What is your monthly revenue?

      Then score the 4 Market Indicators (0-10 each):
      - Massive Pain: Does the audience desperately need this?
      - Purchasing Power: Can they afford it?
      - Easy to Target: Can you find and reach them?
      - Growing: Is this market expanding?

      GATE: All 4 indicators must be >= 7 to proceed.
      If any < 5: STOP and recommend market pivot.

  # SECTION 2: VALUE EQUATION DIAGNOSTIC
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: value-equation
    title: "Phase 1 — Value Equation Diagnostic"
    instruction: |
      Score the current offer (or proposed offer) against the Value Equation:
      Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay + Effort & Sacrifice)

      For each variable, score 1-10 using these anchors:

      Dream Outcome:
        1-3: Vague promise, no transformation
        4-6: Clear benefit, no status/emotional connection
        7-8: Vivid transformation with status implications
        9-10: "People will ask what happened to you" level

      Perceived Likelihood:
        1-3: No proof, no guarantee, trust me bro
        4-6: Some testimonials, weak guarantee
        7-8: Strong case studies, performance guarantee
        9-10: "30 clients in 30 days or you don't pay" level

      Time Delay (inverted — lower delay = higher score):
        1-3: Months to first result
        4-6: Weeks to first result
        7-8: Days to first tangible outcome
        9-10: Immediate value upon purchase

      Effort & Sacrifice (inverted — lower effort = higher score):
        1-3: Client does all the work (DIY)
        4-6: Guided, significant effort required
        7-8: Done-with-you, minimal effort
        9-10: Done-for-you, client does almost nothing

      Identify the WEAKEST variable — that is the highest leverage fix.
    elicit: true

        Value = (9 x 5) / (4 + 7)
        Value = 45 / 11 = 4.1
        ```

        | Variable | Score | Assessment |
        |----------|-------|------------|
        | Dream Outcome | 9/10 | "Get the body of a 25-year-old at 45" — vivid, status-loaded |
        | Perceived Likelihood | 5/10 | Only 3 testimonials, no guarantee. Trust gap. |
        | Time Delay | 4/10 | First visible results in 6 weeks. Too slow. |
        | Effort & Sacrifice | 7/10 | Custom meal plans delivered, workouts programmed. Low effort. |

        **Weakest Variable:** Time Delay (4/10)
        **Highest Leverage Move:** Add a "First 48h Win" — body composition scan + personalized action plan delivered within 2 hours of purchase. Score jumps from 4 to 7.

  # SECTION 3: OFFER ENGINEERING
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: offer-engineering
    title: "Phase 2 — Grand Slam Offer Engineering"
    instruction: |
      Build the complete offer stack. For each component, the agent must:
      1. Define the core offer (primary deliverable)
      2. List ALL problems the avatar faces (minimum 10)
      3. For each problem, create a solution
      4. Bundle solutions into delivery vehicles (courses, tools, access, services)
      5. Trim to highest-value components
      6. Design bonuses (each resolves a specific remaining objection)
      7. Design guarantee (unconditional, conditional, or performance)
      8. Define real scarcity mechanism
      9. Define real urgency mechanism

      CRITICAL: Every bonus must resolve a SPECIFIC objection. Never add bonuses
      for the sake of adding value. Each bonus answers "But what about [objection]?"

      Price must create minimum 10:1 value-to-price ratio.
