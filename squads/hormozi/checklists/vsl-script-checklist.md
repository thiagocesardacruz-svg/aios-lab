## Hormozi VSL Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Control the Timing
```
"VSL controls o tempo de exposicao a mensagem. A person who watches
a VSL cannot skim. They experience your pitch at YOUR pace."
```

### Rule 2: One-on-One Conversation
```
"A VSL is not a video commercial. It's a 1-on-1 sales conversation
filmed once and delivered infinitely."
```

### Rule 3: Natural Delivery
```
"If you can't say it naturally to one person across a table,
don't put it in a VSL."
```

### Rule 4: Real Urgency Only
```
"Real urgency amplifies. Fake urgency destroys."
```

### Rule 5: Stack the Proof
```
"Proof depth must match price point. The higher the ask,
the more evidence required."
```
