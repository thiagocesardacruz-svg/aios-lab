## Phase 0: Pre-Flight Validation

### Market & Timing Readiness
- [ ] Have I raised prices at least once in the past 12 months?
  - *Source: Page 6 - "Raise prices at least once per year"*
- [ ] Is there a major product launch within 90 days I can pair this with?
  - *Source: Page 6 - "If you can, pair a price raise within 90 days of a launch"*
- [ ] Have I avoided grandfathering customers into permanent legacy pricing?
  - *Source: Page 6 - "Don't grandfather existing customers"*
- [ ] Have I avoided selling lifetime access for one-time payment?
  - *Source: Page 6 - "Never sell a 'one time price' for lifetime access"*

### Business Health Check

- [ ] OR is this an emergency like Trey's (do-or-die situation)?
  - *Source: Page 1-2 - "in 12 more weeks, you won't have a gym"*

## Phase 1: Analysis & Testing

### New Customer Price Testing
- [ ] **Decide on price increase amount**
  - *Source: Page 23 Checklist - "Decide on price increase"*

- [ ] **Test with new customers first**
  - [ ] New price live for incoming customers
  - [ ] Minimum 2-4 weeks of data collected
  - [ ] Conversion rate tracked at new price
  - [ ] Churn rate tracked at new price
  - [ ] *Source: Page 6 - "Test price raises on new customers before rolling out"*

- [ ] **Validate test results make money**
  - [ ] If conversion + retention = increased revenue: PROCEED
  - [ ] If not: adjust price and retest
  - *Source: Page 23 Checklist - "If they buy and stay at rates that increase how much money you make, continue"*

### Breakeven Calculation
- [ ] **Calculate maximum acceptable churn**
  ```
  Max Churn = 1 - (Old Price / New Price)

  Max Churn = 1 - ($10/$20) = 50%
  Even losing 50% = same revenue
  ```
  - *Source: Page 6 - "You should know what percentage of customers you can lose and still make money"*

- [ ] **Document breakeven number before proceeding**
  - Breakeven churn percentage: _______%
  - Current customer count: _______
  - Minimum customers needed: _______

### Customer Segmentation
- [ ] **Segment out 'old' customers before the price raise**

## Communication Templates

### Template A: Standard RAISE Letter

```
Dear [NAME],

Over the past [X] months, we've added so much value to [PRODUCT/SERVICE]:
  - [PERSONALIZED VALUE 1]
  - [PERSONALIZED VALUE 2]
  - [PERSONALIZED VALUE 3]

For us to continue to invest in making [PRODUCT] for you and the
[CUSTOMER COMPANY] team, we need to increase our prices.

With these extra resources, we're going to:
  - [INVESTMENT 1] -> [CUSTOMER BENEFIT]
  - [INVESTMENT 2] -> [CUSTOMER BENEFIT]
  - [INVESTMENT 3] -> [CUSTOMER BENEFIT]

You've been insanely loyal to [YOUR COMPANY] though, using us for the
past [X] months. So, as of today we're raising prices on new customers,
but since you've been so loyal we're going to keep you on your existing
plan for the next [3-6 MONTHS]. So we are giving you a [$XXX] credit
as a way of saying thank you (after which we'll bump you up to the
new price of $XXX).

Thank you for letting us be a part of [COMPANY]'s mission. If you have
any questions at all, let me know. All replies go directly to me.

[YOUR NAME]

PS - [B2C]: if this will materially affect your ability to buy groceries,
let me know and we'll work something out.

PS - [B2B]: if this materially impacts your business, let me know and
we'll work something out.
```

### Template B: Type 2 Response Script

```
"Don't worry, we got you. Why don't we extend your discount another
6 months, then reach out then. Is that fair?"
```

### Template C: Stair-Step Offer

```
"Let's do this differently. We'll give you:
- $200/mo off for the first 4 months
- $100/mo off for the next 3 months
- $50/mo off for the final 3 months

This lets you ease into the new pricing gradually. Sound fair?"
```

### Template D: New Customer "Friend Paid Less" Response

```
"That may feel like bad news but it's actually good news.

First - it's good news because we just keep making the value better.

And, to give you some confidence, 96% of our customers agreed. And
they should know - they're already using it.

Beyond that - the good news is - this is the cheapest it'll ever be.
So there will never be a better time to get started."
```
