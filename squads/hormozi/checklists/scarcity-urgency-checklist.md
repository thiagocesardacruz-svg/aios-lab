## Quality Gate Checkpoints

### QG-001: Honesty Gate (BLOCKING)

Before ANY scarcity-urgency deployment:

- [ ] Limit is real and enforceable
- [ ] Deadline is real and will be honored
- [ ] No "fake scarcity" elements

**If failed:** Use honest scarcity or do not deploy

### QG-002: Sell-Out Gate (WARNING)

At end of limited campaign:

- [ ] Campaign sold out (or close to it)

**If failed:** Reduce limit next time

### QG-003: Deadline Enforcement Gate (BLOCKING)

When late request comes in:

- [ ] Deadline was honored (no exceptions)
- [ ] Customer redirected to next opportunity

**If failed:** Escalate - credibility at risk

### QG-004: Announcement Gate (WARNING)

After sell-out:

- [ ] Sell-out was announced publicly

**If failed:** Announce immediately - this is part of the strategy

### QG-005: Credibility Gate (BLOCKING)

Campaign review:

- [ ] No fake scarcity claims made
- [ ] All limits were honored
- [ ] No deadline exceptions granted

**If failed:** Audit and correct before next campaign

### QG-006: Compound Effect Gate (WARNING)

Quarterly review:

- [ ] Effectiveness improving or stable
- [ ] Time-to-sell-out not increasing
- [ ] Waitlist not shrinking

**If failed:** Strategy refresh required

---

## Metrics Tracking Checklist

### Primary Metrics

- [ ] Sell-out rate tracked (target: >80%)
- [ ] Decision speed tracked (target: faster than baseline)
- [ ] Last-day sales percentage tracked (benchmark: 30-60%)

### Secondary Metrics

- [ ] Waitlist conversion rate
- [ ] Price objection frequency
- [ ] Repeat buyer rate post-exposure
- [ ] Time-to-sell-out trend

### Compound Effect Tracking

- [ ] Campaign-over-campaign comparison active
- [ ] Quarterly trend analysis scheduled
- [ ] Improvement/decline patterns monitored

---

## Post-Campaign Review Checklist

### Performance Review

- [ ] Did we sell out? (If no, limit was too high)
- [ ] Did last-day spike occur? (If no, urgency needs work)
- [ ] Were all limits honored? (If no, credibility risk)
- [ ] Was sell-out announced? (If no, missed opportunity)

### Credibility Review

- [ ] Any customer complaints about fake scarcity?
- [ ] Any deadline exceptions granted?
- [ ] Any capacity violations?
- [ ] Public perception intact?

### Compound Effect Review

- [ ] Is sell-out time improving?
- [ ] Is waitlist growing?
- [ ] Are price objections decreasing?
- [ ] Are repeat purchases increasing?

### Optimization Notes

- [ ] What worked well?
- [ ] What needs improvement?
- [ ] Limit adjustments for next time?
- [ ] Urgency messaging refinements?

## Quick Reference: Do's and Don'ts

### DO:

- Set limits BELOW expected demand
- ALWAYS sell out (better than oversupply)
- ALWAYS announce sell-outs
- Enforce deadlines without exception

### DON'T:

- Use fake scarcity or urgency
- Reopen after deadline closes
- Make exceptions for late requests
- Over-order and fail to sell out
- Skip the sell-out announcement
- Use the same fake countdown everyone uses
- Damage credibility for short-term gains
