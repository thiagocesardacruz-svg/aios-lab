## Pre-Flight Check

Before implementing the LTV framework, verify:

### Business Validation

- [ ] **Product validated** - At least 10 satisfied paying customers
- [ ] **CAC documented** - Cost of Acquisition known and consistent
- [ ] **Delivery capacity** - Can deliver 2x current volume
- [ ] **Payment system ready** - Processor accepts plans and recurring billing
- [ ] **Cash runway** - 3 months of expenses OR credit line available
- [ ] **Tracking installed** - Conversion metrics by stage

### Red Flags - NOT Ready If:

- [ ] **Refund rate > 5%** - Product issues must be fixed first
- [ ] **Can't explain value in 30 seconds** - Messaging needs work
- [ ] **No testimonials/case studies** - Social proof missing
- [ ] **Gross margin < 30%** - Unit economics don't work
- [ ] **Churn > 10% monthly** - Retention crisis

### Scope Validation

**Applies to:**
- [ ] Businesses with recurring products/services
- [ ] Medium to high ticket offers ($500+)
- [ ] Documented CAC
- [ ] B2B and B2C with defined sales cycle

**Does NOT apply to:**
- [ ] Commodities without differentiation
- [ ] Businesses without scalable delivery capacity
- [ ] Gross margin < 30%
- [ ] Refund rate > 5%

## SECTION A: Four Pillars of LTV Validation

### A.1: Pillar 1 - 30-Day Profit

- [ ] **Formula understood** - L30 = (P1 x C1) + Sum(Un x Cn x Vn) - CAC - COGS
- [ ] **CAC calculated** - Cost of Acquisition documented
- [ ] **COGS calculated** - Cost of Goods/Services documented
- [ ] **Upsell revenue projected** - Each upsell priced and conversion estimated
- [ ] **30-day profit positive** - Covers CAC + COGS in 30 days
- [ ] **Credit card strategy enabled** - Can use CC as infinite working capital
- [ ] **Consequence understood** - Negative = run out of cash, stop advertising, die slowly

**Formula Calculator:**
```
Initial Price (P1): ____________
Conversion Rate (C1): ____________%
Upsell Revenue Sum: ____________
CAC: ____________
COGS: ____________
30-Day Profit (L30): ____________
[ ] PASS (L30 > 0)
[ ] FAIL (fix offer or add upsells)
```

### A.2: Pillar 2 - Problem-Solution Sequence

- [ ] **Core problem identified** - What your main offer solves
- [ ] **Revealed problems mapped** - Each solution creates new problems
- [ ] **Upsell chain designed** - Each problem has a solution product
- [ ] **Chain is 3+ deep** - Multiple upsell opportunities exist
- [ ] **Problems are genuine** - Not manufactured or forced
- [ ] **Solutions provide real value** - Actually help customers
- [ ] **Consequence understood** - Ignoring = lose 80% of potential profit

**Problem-Solution Examples Validated:**
```
[ ] Rented car -> needs insurance (problem created)
[ ] Fitness challenge -> needs supplements (problem created)
[ ] Software -> needs training (problem created)
```

### A.3: Pillar 3 - Value Anchoring

- [ ] **Anchor price defined** - Premium option 5-10x main price
- [ ] **Premium is genuine** - Would happily fulfill if purchased
- [ ] **Presentation order correct** - Most expensive shown first
- [ ] **Psychological recalibration works** - Other options seem cheap
- [ ] **Consequence understood** - Ignoring = customers always buy cheapest option

**Suit Store Case Study Validated:**
```
[ ] Customer budget: $500
[ ] First suit presented: $16,000
[ ] Second suit presented: $2,200
[ ] Customer bought: $2,200 + $300 accessories = $2,500 (5x budget)
```

### A.4: Pillar 4 - Zero Friction

- [ ] **Card on file enabled** - Can charge without re-asking
- [ ] **No "do you want to buy?"** - Ask "which card?" instead
- [ ] **Payment barriers removed** - Nothing between decision and charge
- [ ] **Multiple payment options** - Credit, debit, financing available
- [ ] **Consequence understood** - 50% of closed sales die in payment friction

### D.2: Offer #7 - Menu Upsell

**Formula:** Unsell -> Prescribe -> A/B -> Card on File

**Four Tactics Present:**

- [ ] **PRESCRIPTION** - Tell what they need, how to use, when, how much
- [ ] **A/B CHOICE** - "Chocolate or vanilla?" removes "yes/no" -> both choices = sale
- [ ] **CARD ON FILE** - "Use the card on file?" -> 40% conversion increase

- [ ] Step 2: Wait for the gasp
- [ ] Step 3: Come to rescue: "Voce se importa muito com [premium feature]?"
- [ ] Step 4: Present main offer
- [ ] Step 5: Ask how they want to pay

**CRITICAL:**
- [ ] Treat anchor as REAL offer - If fake, lose trust
- [ ] Quote understood: "The only thing worse than making a $1,000 offer to someone with a $100 budget is making a $100 offer to someone with a $1,000 budget"

**Base Calculation Validated:**
```
Without anchor: 30 buy at $2,200 = $66,000
With anchor: 15 premium at $16k + 45 main at $2.2k = $240k + $99k = $339k

## SECTION E: Stage III - Downsell Offers (Turn No's into Yes's) Validation

### E.1: Downselling Rules

- [ ] **Rule 1** - "No" means no to THIS offer, not all offers
- [ ] **Rule 2** - Downsells are TRADES - give something, get something
- [ ] **Rule 3** - Personalize, don't pressure
- [ ] **Rule 4** - Same thing in NEW ways
- [ ] **Rule 5** - NEVER lower price on same thing - change offer with price
- [ ] **Rule 6** - Customers talk about price - consistency matters

### E.2: Offer #10 - Payment Plan Downsell

**7-Step Process (stop when they buy):**
- [ ] Step 1: Reward paying in full (price WITH interest -> prepay = discount)
- [ ] Step 2: Third-party financing / credit card / layaway
  - [ ] "Do you prefer that I decide your terms or YOU decide?" -> "I decide" -> card
- [ ] Step 3: Half now, half later (align with pay day)
- [ ] Step 4: CHECK: Scale 1-10. 8+ continue. 7- switch to feature downsell
- [ ] Step 5: Divide into three payments
- [ ] Step 6: Spread evenly (e.g., 16 weeks = 16 payments)
- [ ] Step 7: Free trial (-> Trial with Penalty)

**Seesaw Technique Script:**
- [ ] "Giant or small monthly payments?" -> "Small"
- [ ] "Prepay today: massive discount + zero monthly. Does that work?"
- [ ] If no: "The more you give now = smaller monthly payments"

**Churn by Billing (14,000 companies via ProfitWell):**
```
Monthly:     10.7% churn/month
Quarterly:   5% churn/month
Annual:      2% churn/month
RULE: Double period = half churn. Always start high.
[ ] VALIDATED
```

**Base Calculation Validated:**
```
Without plan: 30 buy at $1,000 = $30,000
With plan downsell: 30 full + 20 plans (80% complete) = $30k + $16k = $46,000
Lift: 53% revenue increase
[ ] VALIDATED
```

### E.3: Offer #11 - Trial with Penalty

**Formula:** "If you do X, Y, Z, I'll let you start for free."

**5 Steps:**
- [ ] Step 1: Offer trial LAST (only after main rejected)
- [ ] Step 2: ALWAYS get card ("Which card?" / "How we've always done it")
- [ ] Step 3: Sell staying and paying ("If it works, will you stay long-term?")
- [ ] Step 4: Explain fees AFTER card (not before -> more resistance)
- [ ] Step 5: MANDATORY check-ins (your upsell opportunities)

**Post-Trial Handling:**
- [ ] **Loved it:** Easy upsell to bigger/longer service
- [ ] **Hated it:** "You're right, I'm upset. Your needs match our premium." (50% buy)
- [ ] **Didn't use:** Contact multiple times, waive fee if they show up

**Base Calculation Validated:**
```
100 leads: 30 buy main $1,000 + 40 trial
8 fail criteria ($200 penalty) + 24 convert ($500/month)
30 days: $30,000 + $1,600 + $12,000 = $43,600 -> 45% lift
[ ] VALIDATED
```

### E.4: Offer #12 - Feature Downsell

**Formula:** Remove feature -> lower price -> "How about now?"

**The Guarantee Hack:**
```
Full offer $1,000 with guarantee: 25 buy
Remove guarantee, $600: some buy THIS
BUT many reconsider -> buy FULL $1,000 because NOW they see guarantee value
Result: 35 full + 40 without = 75 total (was 25) -> 3x close rate
[ ] VALIDATED
```

**What to Remove (highest value first to trigger re-upsell):**
- [ ] Quantity
- [ ] Quality
- [ ] Service level
- [ ] Availability
- [ ] Speed
- [ ] Ratio
- [ ] Communication
- [ ] Provider
- [ ] Live vs recorded
- [ ] DIY vs DFY
- [ ] Personalization
- [ ] Insurance/Guarantee
- [ ] Entire features

**Base Calculation Validated:**
```
Before: 25 x $1,000 = $25,000
After: 35 x $1,000 + 40 x $600 = $59,000 -> 2.36x lift
40% of downsell buyers eventually upgrade

[ ] Pricing calculated

vs challenge-only: $20,196/year -> 2.27x lift ARR
[ ] VALIDATED
```

### F.2: Offer #14 - Continuity Discount

**Formula:** Free time with commitment
- [ ] "3 months free with 12-month commit" = 25% off effective

[ ] VALIDATED
```

### F.3: Offer #15 - Waived Fee

**Formula:** Setup fee with month-to-month OR waived with annual commit

**Structure:**
- [ ] Option A: $5,000 setup + $1,000/month, cancel anytime
- [ ] Option B: $0 setup, 12-month commit at $1,000/month
- [ ] Early exit = pay waived fee
- [ ] 85% choose commitment. Churn <5%.

**Psychology:**
- [ ] People START to avoid fee
- [ ] People STAY because leaving > staying
- [ ] After commitment: fee disappears forever (equitable)

**Cause-Based Cancellation (Advanced):**
- [ ] "What cause do you absolutely HATE?"
- [ ] "If you cancel early, I'm donating your fee to them"
- [ ] Double aversion = 50% additional churn reduction

**Setup Parameters:**
- [ ] Duration: 12 months minimum
- [ ] Fee: 3-5x monthly
- [ ] Early exit: Pay waived fee
- [ ] If >5% want out early -> investigate product, not pricing

**Base Calculation Validated:**
```
85 annual $1,000/month = $1,020,000
15 month-to-month $5,000 setup + $15,000/month
Year 1: $1,020k + $75k + $120k = $1,215,000
Without fee: 100 x $1,000 x average 6 months = $600,000 -> 2x+ lift

## SECTION H: D.I.E. Framework Validation

### H.1: DIAGNOSE - Where's the problem?

- [ ] **CAC known** - Cost to acquire one customer
- [ ] **Average ticket known** - Revenue per sale
- [ ] **Conversion known** - % who buy
- [ ] **Churn known** - % who leave per month
- [ ] **Billing cycle known** - Monthly, quarterly, annual
- [ ] **LTGP:CAC calculated** - Ratio determined

### I.2: Sequence Validation

- [ ] **Not skipping steps** - Each priority addressed in order
- [ ] **Each stage profitable** - Before moving to next
- [ ] **One stage per quarter** - Not everything at once

## SECTION J: 10 Counter-Intuitive Truths Validation

- [ ] **#1 Free costs more than paid** - Free 40% show-up, $1 = 80%, $10 = 90%
- [ ] **#2 More offers = more sales** - 9 sequential = 3x conversion vs 1
- [ ] **#3 Higher price = less churn** - 14,000 companies prove it
- [ ] **#4 Penalties increase satisfaction** - 80% completion vs 20%
- [ ] **#5 Start expensive = sell more cheap** - $16k anchor -> $2.2k seems like a deal

- [ ] "Great! Now that you have [solution A], you need to solve [problem B created by A]. 90% of our clients who get [result] also get [product B]. You can't have [final result] without [product B]. Want to add for just $[X] instead of the normal $[2X]? ...You don't want anything else, do you?" [No = Yes]

### O.2: Downsell Seesaw Script
- [ ] "Prefer giant or small monthly payments?" [Customer: Small]
- [ ] "Normally costs $[X], but if you prepay today, zero monthly payments. Does that work?"
- [ ] [If no] "The more you give now, the smaller your payments. What amount works today?"

### O.3: Trial with Penalty Script
- [ ] "How about we start you for free? I just need the card to guarantee commitment. If you do everything right, you pay nothing. If you skip something, small fee to keep you on track. It's how we've always done it. Fair?"

### O.4: Anchor Script
- [ ] "We have two options. First, our [premium] for $[5-10x]. Includes [everything]."
- [ ] [Wait for gasp] "Do you care a lot about [premium feature]?"
- [ ] [Customer: No] "Perfect. Then our [main] for $[X] is exactly what you need. Which card do you prefer?"
