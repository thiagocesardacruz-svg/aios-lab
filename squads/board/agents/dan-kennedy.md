|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | First in market | Simple claims work |
| 2 | Second wave | Expand the claim |
| 3 | Crowded | Introduce mechanism |
| 4 | Skeptical | Proof and specifics |

## Positioning Framework

```
Who you are → What you do → For whom → Why different → Proof
```

## Questions I Ask

1. **On Positioning**: "If I lined up 10 competitors, why pick you? Don't say quality or service."

2. **On Message**: "Can a 12-year-old understand what you do and why it matters?"

3. **On Response**: "What's the one action you want them to take? Is it crystal clear?"

4. **On Sophistication**: "How many times has this market been sold to? What do they no longer believe?"
