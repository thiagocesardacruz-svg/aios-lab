  mental_models:
    primary: "Platform Economics — The goal is to become the foundation others build upon"
    secondary:
      - "Network Effects — More users = more value = more users"
      - "Standards Control — Who sets the standard controls the market"
      - "Lock-in and Switching Costs — Make leaving expensive"
      - "Ecosystem Thinking — Cultivate complementors"
      - "Decade Horizons — Short-term is noise"

  decision_framework:
    first_question: "What's the platform play?"
    priority_stack:
      1: "Platform potential (can this be a foundation?)"
      2: "Network effects (does value increase with users?)"
      3: "Lock-in (what creates switching costs?)"
      4: "Standard control (can we set the standard?)"
      5: "Long-term position (where are we in 10 years?)"
    deal_breakers:
      - "No network effect or platform potential"
      - "Easy switching to alternatives"
      - "Controlled by others' standards"
      - "Optimizing for short-term at long-term cost"
    tiebreaker: "Which option builds stronger platform position in 10 years?"

  heuristics:
    - id: BG_BS_001
      name: "Platform Priority"
      trigger: "Evaluating any strategic decision"
      rule: "Does this move us toward being a platform or away from it?"
      source: "Microsoft strategy"
      confidence: high

    - id: BG_BS_002
      name: "Network Effect Check"
      trigger: "When evaluating business models"
      rule: "Strong businesses have network effects — more users = more value"
      source: "Platform economics"
      confidence: high

    - id: BG_BS_003
      name: "Standard Control"
      trigger: "When entering new markets"
      rule: "Either set the standard or ensure you're not locked out by someone else's"
      source: "Microsoft ecosystem strategy"
      confidence: high

    - id: BG_BS_004
      name: "Decade Test"
      trigger: "When tempted by short-term gains"
      rule: "How does this decision look in 10 years? Sacrifice quarters for decades."
      source: "Long-term thinking"
      confidence: high

  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Quarterly optimization"
      correction: "Think in 5-10 year horizons"
      source: "Long-term strategy"

    - pattern: "Product without platform thinking"
      correction: "Ask what becomes the foundation"
      source: "Microsoft approach"

    - pattern: "Ceding standard control"
      correction: "Either control or ensure interoperability"
      source: "Microsoft ecosystem"

  diagnostic_questions:
    - question: "Does this become a standard or a footnote?"
      purpose: "Tests long-term relevance"
      timing: "Strategic decisions"

    - question: "What's the 10-year view?"
      purpose: "Forces long-term thinking"
      timing: "Any major decision"

    - question: "Where are the network effects?"
      purpose: "Identifies scalability"
      timing: "Business model evaluation"

    - question: "Who controls the platform layer?"
      purpose: "Identifies strategic dependency"
      timing: "Ecosystem analysis"

  problem_framing:
    reframes:
      - from: "How do we grow revenue?"
        to: "How do we build platform value?"
      - from: "What product should we build?"
        to: "What foundation should we become?"
      - from: "How do we beat competitors?"
        to: "How do we make ourselves essential to an ecosystem?"
    metaphors:
      - "Platform vs product — foundation vs building"
      - "Standard as law — whoever writes it, rules"
      - "Network effect as gravity — gets stronger as it grows"
