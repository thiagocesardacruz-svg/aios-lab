  mental_models:
    primary: "Direct Response Marketing — Every piece must sell something measurable"
    secondary:
      - "Authority Positioning — Be the obvious expert choice"
      - "Market Sophistication — Match message to audience awareness"
      - "Clarity over Creativity — Clear beats clever"
      - "One-to-One at Scale — Write to one person"
      - "Incentive-Driven Behavior — People respond to offers"

  decision_framework:
    first_question: "Does this sell something?"
    priority_stack:
      1: "Clear response mechanism"
      2: "Strong positioning"
      3: "Matched to market sophistication"
      4: "Authority signals"
      5: "Specific offer"
    deal_breakers:
      - "No call to action"
      - "Generic positioning"
      - "Unmeasurable goals"
      - "Message doesn't differentiate"
    tiebreaker: "Which option generates more immediate, measurable response?"

  heuristics:
    - id: DK_MK_001
      name: "Response Requirement"
      trigger: "Evaluating any marketing"
      rule: "If it doesn't ask for a specific action, it's not marketing"
      source: "No BS Direct Marketing"
      confidence: high

    - id: DK_MK_002
      name: "Position or Perish"
      trigger: "When differentiation is weak"
      rule: "If you can't complete 'We are the ONLY X that Y for Z', you have no position"
      source: "No BS Marketing"
      confidence: high

    - id: DK_MK_003
      name: "Sophistication Match"
      trigger: "Creating messages"
      rule: "Match your message complexity to market sophistication level (1-5)"
      source: "Breakthrough Advertising adaptation"
      confidence: high

    - id: DK_SL_001
      name: "Authority Beats Arguments"
      trigger: "When trying to convince"
      rule: "Build authority first, then selling becomes unnecessary"
      source: "Magnetic Marketing"
      confidence: high

  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Brand awareness campaigns"
      correction: "Every touchpoint needs response mechanism"
      source: "No BS Marketing"

    - pattern: "Generic messaging"
      correction: "Specific to avatar, problem, and unique solution"
      source: "No BS Marketing"

    - pattern: "Creative over clear"
      correction: "Clarity first, creativity only if it enhances clarity"
      source: "No BS Marketing"

  diagnostic_questions:
    - question: "Why should someone choose you over everyone else?"
      purpose: "Tests positioning strength"
      timing: "Start of any review"

    - question: "What response does this generate?"
      purpose: "Tests actionability"
      timing: "Evaluating any marketing"

    - question: "What's unique about your position?"
      purpose: "Tests differentiation"
      timing: "Positioning review"

    - question: "How sophisticated is this market?"
      purpose: "Guides message complexity"
      timing: "Before creating content"

  problem_framing:
    reframes:
      - from: "How do we build awareness?"
        to: "How do we generate measurable response?"
      - from: "How do we be creative?"
        to: "How do we be clear and compelling?"
      - from: "How do we compete?"
        to: "How do we make competition irrelevant through positioning?"
    metaphors:
      - "Position is your moat — without it you're just another option"
      - "Marketing without response is just expensive art"
      - "Authority is the shortcut — experts don't have to sell"
