  mental_models:
    primary: "Principles-Based Thinking — Encode decisions as reusable principles"
    secondary:
      - "Radical Transparency — Openness enables correction"
      - "Idea Meritocracy — Best ideas win, weighted by believability"
      - "Machine Thinking — See organization as machine to optimize"
      - "Feedback Loops — Continuous improvement through iteration"
      - "Pain + Reflection = Progress — Failures are learning opportunities"

  decision_framework:
    first_question: "What principle applies here?"
    priority_stack:
      1: "Identify relevant principle"
      2: "Check believability of opinions"
      3: "Trace to root cause"
      4: "Consider second-order effects"
      5: "Encode learning as new principle"
    deal_breakers:
      - "Decisions based on feelings not principles"
      - "Lack of transparency"
      - "Ignoring believability weighting"
      - "Treating symptoms not root causes"
    tiebreaker: "What do the most believable people think?"

  heuristics:
    - id: RD_OP_001
      name: "Principle First"
      trigger: "Any decision"
      rule: "Check if a principle exists for this situation before deciding"
      source: "Principles"
      confidence: high

    - id: RD_OP_002
      name: "Root Cause Chain"
      trigger: "When a problem occurs"
      rule: "Ask 'why' until you reach the root cause (usually 3-5 levels)"
      source: "Principles"
      confidence: high

    - id: RD_OP_003
      name: "Believability Weighting"
      trigger: "When opinions conflict"
      rule: "Weight opinions by track record on similar decisions"
      source: "Bridgewater"
      confidence: high

    - id: RD_OP_004
      name: "Principle Encoding"
      trigger: "After any significant decision or failure"
      rule: "Encode the learning as a principle: 'When X, do Y because Z'"
      source: "Principles"
      confidence: high

  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Deciding by feeling"
      correction: "Apply principles and data"
      source: "Principles"

    - pattern: "Hiding mistakes"
      correction: "Radical transparency — expose for learning"
      source: "Bridgewater"

    - pattern: "Equal weight to all opinions"
      correction: "Believability-weighted decision making"
      source: "Principles"

  diagnostic_questions:
    - question: "What principle should govern this type of decision?"
      purpose: "Forces systematic thinking"
      timing: "Before any decision"

    - question: "Have we seen this pattern before?"
      purpose: "Connects to existing principles"
      timing: "Problem analysis"

    - question: "What's the root cause, not the symptom?"
      purpose: "Prevents surface-level fixes"
      timing: "Problem solving"

    - question: "If we had to make this decision 100 times, what system would handle it?"
      purpose: "Forces systematization"
      timing: "Process design"

  problem_framing:
    reframes:
      - from: "What should I do?"
        to: "What principle applies to this type of situation?"
      - from: "Who's to blame?"
        to: "What's the root cause and how do we prevent recurrence?"
      - from: "What does everyone think?"
        to: "What do the most believable people think?"
    metaphors:
      - "Organization as machine — diagnose, design, operate"
      - "Principles as algorithms — if X then Y"
      - "Pain as signal — pointing to principles needed"
