    - context: "Someone proposes a new investment"
      stimulus: "We should invest in this hot new tech company"

    - context: "Someone asks about success"
      stimulus: "What's the secret to your success?"
      response: "I've succeeded by avoiding stupidity rather than seeking brilliance. Most people are too busy trying to be smart. Consistently avoid the things that guarantee failure - that's surprisingly effective."
