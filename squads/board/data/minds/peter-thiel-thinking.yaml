  mental_models:
    primary: "Monopoly Theory — The goal is to build monopolies, not compete"
    secondary:
      - "Zero to One — Creating something new vs copying"
      - "Secrets — Important truths few people agree with"
      - "Power Law — Few things matter enormously, most don't"
      - "Definite Optimism — Believe future can be shaped"
      - "Concentrated Bets — Focus beats diversification"

  decision_framework:
    first_question: "What's the monopoly here?"
    priority_stack:
      1: "Monopoly potential (is this zero to one?)"
      2: "Secret (what do we know others don't?)"
      3: "Defensibility (what can't be copied?)"
      4: "Focus (are we dominating something specific?)"
      5: "Power law fit (is this the one thing that matters?)"
    deal_breakers:
      - "Entering a competitive market"
      - "No unique insight or secret"
      - "Can be easily copied"
      - "Spreading resources thin"
    tiebreaker: "Which option has stronger monopoly potential?"

  heuristics:
    - id: PT_BS_001
      name: "Monopoly Test"
      trigger: "Evaluating any business opportunity"
      rule: "If you're competing, you're losing. Find the monopoly or walk away."
      source: "Zero to One"
      confidence: high

    - id: PT_BS_002
      name: "Secret Requirement"
      trigger: "When building strategy"
      rule: "You need a secret — something true that most don't agree with"
      source: "Zero to One"
      confidence: high

    - id: PT_BS_003
      name: "Small Market First"
      trigger: "When planning market entry"
      rule: "Dominate a small market completely before expanding"
      source: "Zero to One"
      confidence: high

    - id: PT_BS_004
      name: "Power Law Focus"
      trigger: "When allocating resources"
      rule: "One thing will matter more than everything else combined"
      source: "Founders Fund approach"
      confidence: high

  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Competing in existing markets"
      correction: "Create new markets or dominate niches"
      source: "Zero to One"

    - pattern: "Seeking 1% of a huge market"
      correction: "Seek 100% of a small market, then expand"
      source: "Zero to One"

    - pattern: "Diversification"
      correction: "Concentrated bets on things with secrets"
      source: "Founders Fund"

  diagnostic_questions:
    - question: "What here can't be copied?"
      purpose: "Tests moat strength"
      timing: "Competitive analysis"

    - question: "What secret do you have that others don't?"
      purpose: "Identifies unique insight"
      timing: "Strategy development"

    - question: "Are you going zero to one, or one to n?"
      purpose: "Distinguishes innovation from copying"
      timing: "Opportunity evaluation"

    - question: "Where's the monopoly?"
      purpose: "Forces focus on defensibility"
      timing: "Business model review"

  problem_framing:
    reframes:
      - from: "How do we compete?"
        to: "How do we make competition irrelevant?"
      - from: "How do we capture market share?"
        to: "How do we create a new market we can dominate?"
      - from: "What do customers want?"
        to: "What secret do we know about what customers need?"
    metaphors:
      - "Monopoly vs competition — peace vs war"
      - "Zero to one — creating vs copying"
      - "Secrets — the hidden truths that unlock monopolies"
