## Reference: Key Statistics

| Statistic | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| 1% pricing = 2x retention efficiency | Profitwell (512 companies) |
| 1% pricing = 4x acquisition efficiency | Profitwell |
| 2x price = 6x profit | Hormozi calculation |
| See's Candies: 50+ years, avg 10%/year | Warren Buffett |
| Gym Launch: $42K → $239K = 469% ROI | Hormozi example |

## Reference: Key Formulas

```
VALUE EQUATION:
Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort/Sacrifice)

BREAKEVEN FORMULA:
Breakeven = (Old Revenue) / (New Price x (1 - Expected Churn Increase))

ROI FORMULA:
ROI_Cliente = (Expected Result - Price) / Price x 100%
Threshold: >300%

PRICE TEST RULE:
2x price + -20% conversion = +60% revenue → DO IT
```
