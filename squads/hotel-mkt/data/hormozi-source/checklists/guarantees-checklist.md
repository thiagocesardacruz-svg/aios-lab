## Pre-Flight: Before Designing Your Guarantee

### Product/Service Analysis
- [ ] **Consumability assessed** - Does value deplete upon delivery?
- [ ] **Fulfillment costs documented** - What are hard costs per customer?
- [ ] **Result measurability confirmed** - Can outcomes be objectively measured?
- [ ] **Success factors identified** - What actions must customer take?
- [ ] **Customer control level determined** - How much depends on them vs. you?

### Business Model Fit
- [ ] **Refund economics calculated** - What's acceptable refund rate increase?
- [ ] **Current conversion rate documented** - Baseline established
- [ ] **Current refund rate documented** - Baseline established
- [ ] **Break-even point calculated** - Know when guarantee becomes unprofitable

---

## Guarantee Type Selection

### Decision Checklist
- [ ] **If consumable product** → Consider Anti-Guarantee or Conditional
- [ ] **If high fulfillment cost** → Lean toward Conditional or Anti-Guarantee
- [ ] **If revenue share model** → Use Implied + Anti front-end
- [ ] **If priority is maximum conversions** → Use Unconditional
- [ ] **If priority is maximum results** → Use Conditional tied to actions

### Type Confirmed
- [ ] **Primary type selected**: ______________________
- [ ] **Secondary type (if stacking)**: ______________________
- [ ] **Rationale documented**: ______________________

---

## Unconditional Guarantee Checklist

### Structure
- [ ] **Timeframe defined** (30/60/90 days)
- [ ] **Refund level determined** (full/partial/premium)
- [ ] **Process documented** (how to request)
- [ ] **Response time committed** (e.g., "61 minutes average")

### Framing
- [ ] **"Informed decision" frame used** - Not yes/no, but try to decide
- [ ] **"Inside vs outside" analogy included** - Can't judge from outside
- [ ] **"Happy money" positioning** - Only want to keep if they're happy

### Script Elements
- [ ] **What they get** clearly stated
- [ ] **Timeframe** clearly stated
- [ ] **Process** clearly stated
- [ ] **Your commitment** clearly stated

---

## Conditional Guarantee Checklist

### Conditions Design
- [ ] **Conditions identified** - What must they do?
- [ ] **Conditions are achievable** - 80%+ should be able to meet them
- [ ] **Conditions are trackable** - You can verify compliance
- [ ] **Conditions are specific** - No ambiguity
- [ ] **Conditions tie to success** - Doing them leads to results

### Outcome Design ("Better Than Money Back")
- [ ] **Outcome MORE valuable than simple refund**
- [ ] **Outcome matches customer's goal**
- [ ] **Outcome demonstrates your commitment**

### Outcome Type Selected
- [ ] Result Specific ("X customers in Y days")
- [ ] Work Until Done ("We'll keep working until...")
- [ ] Double Down ("If X fails, we'll do 2X")
- [ ] Extended Credit ("6 extra months free")
- [ ] Performance Pay ("Don't pay unless...")
- [ ] Personal Completion ("I'll fly to your office")
- [ ] Third-Party Validation ("If your spouse doesn't notice...")

### Script Elements
- [ ] **Result X** clearly stated
- [ ] **Time Period Y** clearly stated
- [ ] **Conditions** clearly stated
- [ ] **Consequence Z** clearly stated (the "or what")

### Calibration Check
- [ ] **80%+ compliant customers should achieve threshold**
- [ ] **Ideal: 100% achieve, therefore don't need to claim**

---

## Anti-Guarantee Checklist

### "Reason Why" Development
- [ ] **Shows genuine vulnerability** on your part
- [ ] **Consumer would immediately understand** ("Yeah, that makes sense")
- [ ] **Logical necessity demonstrated**
- [ ] **Not just "because we said so"**

### Reason Category
- [ ] Consumable Logic ("Can't return used shoes")
- [ ] Time Investment ("My time is irreplaceable")
- [ ] Protecting Others ("Fair to committed students")
- [ ] Revenue Share ("I invest with no guarantee")

### Commitment Extraction
- [ ] **Commitment request paired** with anti-guarantee
- [ ] **"Are you in?"** or equivalent close included
- [ ] **Their promise** explicitly requested

### Script Elements
- [ ] **"All sales final"** clearly stated
- [ ] **Reason why** compelling and clear
- [ ] **Vulnerability** shown
- [ ] **Commitment** requested

---

## Implied Guarantee Checklist

### Structure Requirements
- [ ] **Transparency to measure outcome** - Can you actually track results?
- [ ] **Trust/control for compensation** - Will you actually get paid?
- [ ] **Performance clearly defined** - What counts as success?
- [ ] **Upside participation** - You benefit from exceptional results

### Alignment Messaging
- [ ] **"Only make money when you make money"** included
- [ ] **Profit vs. revenue distinction** if applicable
- [ ] **Can't win unless they win** clearly stated
- [ ] **Interests 100% aligned** articulated

### Script Elements
- [ ] **$0 upfront** (if applicable) clearly stated
- [ ] **How you get paid** clearly explained
- [ ] **Alignment of interests** emphasized
- [ ] **Upside potential** mentioned (for credibility)

---

## Guarantee Stacking Checklist

### Stack Validation
- [ ] **Each layer adds unique protection**
- [ ] **Layers don't contradict**
- [ ] **Earlier layers are unconditional** (lower barrier)
- [ ] **Later layers can be conditional** (reward commitment)
- [ ] **Stack doesn't confuse prospect**

### Stacking Patterns Considered
- [ ] Unconditional + Conditional (short-term safety + long-term results)
- [ ] Sequential Conditionals (milestone progression)
- [ ] Anti + Implied (commitment + alignment)
- [ ] Guarantee + Bonus (failure = bonus activation)

---

## Guarantee Naming Checklist

### Anti-Patterns Avoided
- [ ] **NOT using "Satisfaction Guarantee"**
- [ ] **NOT using "Risk-Free Trial"**
- [ ] **NOT using "Money Back Guarantee"**
- [ ] **NOT using generic terms**

### Name Quality
- [ ] **Memorable** - Would someone remember and repeat it?
- [ ] **Vivid** - Creates clear mental image?
- [ ] **Unique** - Differentiates from competitors?
- [ ] **On-brand** - Fits your voice and audience?

### Naming Patterns Considered
- [ ] Extreme Action Test ("Wouldn't [extreme action] to keep it")
- [ ] Superlative Outcome ("3X Your Money Back")
- [ ] Personal Commitment ("I'll Fly To Your Office")

## The "Or What" Gate

**CRITICAL: Every guarantee must pass this check.**

- [ ] **"If X doesn't happen in Y time..."** - WHAT THEN?
- [ ] **Consequence Z is specific** - Not vague promises
- [ ] **Consequence Z has real teeth** - Actually meaningful to customer
- [ ] **Consequence Z you can deliver** - Don't promise what you can't do

**Test:** Can you complete this sentence clearly?
> "If you don't get [RESULT] in [TIMEFRAME], we will [CONSEQUENCE]."

Answer: _______________________________________________________________

## Economics Validation Checklist

### Before Launch
- [ ] **Current conversion rate documented**: _____%
- [ ] **Current refund rate documented**: _____%
- [ ] **Projected conversion with guarantee**: _____%
- [ ] **Projected refund with guarantee**: _____%

### Net Impact Calculation
```
Current Net = Conversions × (1 - Refund Rate) = _____
New Net = New Conversions × (1 - New Refund Rate) = _____
Net Impact = New Net / Current Net = _____x
```

- [ ] **Net impact > 1.0x** (guarantee is profitable)
- [ ] **If net impact < 1.0x** → Adjust guarantee or don't implement

### Break-Even Check
- [ ] **Know your break-even point** - What refund rate kills profitability?
- [ ] **Buffer built in** - Some margin for error

---

## Final Quality Gates

### Gate 1: "Or What" Present
- [ ] Consequence Z clearly defined
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL**

### Gate 2: Economics Validated
- [ ] Net impact > 1.0x projected
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL**

### Gate 3: Condition Clarity (if conditional)
- [ ] All conditions 100% specific and trackable
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL / N/A**

### Gate 4: Reason Why (if anti)
- [ ] Consumer would immediately understand
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL / N/A**

### Gate 5: Name Quality
- [ ] Not using generic terms
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL**

### Gate 6: Risk Addressed

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL**

---

## Post-Launch Monitoring Checklist

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Conversion rate tracked
- [ ] Refund rate tracked
- [ ] Net sales calculated
- [ ] Time to refund request monitored

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Customer quality comparison (guarantee vs. non-guarantee buyers)
- [ ] LTV comparison by acquisition path
- [ ] Condition compliance rate (if conditional)
- [ ] Gaming pattern detection

### Optimization Triggers
- [ ] **If conversion lift < expected** → Strengthen guarantee
- [ ] **If refund rate > expected** → Add/strengthen conditions
- [ ] **If net impact < 1.0x** → PAUSE and reassess

## Quick Reference Card

### The Four Types at a Glance

| Type | Use When | Key Element |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Unconditional** | Max conversions, low-cost products | No questions asked |
| **Conditional** | Want results + customer action | Conditions + Better than $ back |
| **Anti-Guarantee** | Consumables, high cost, revenue share | Strong "reason why" |
| **Implied** | Performance-based models | Only profit when they profit |

### Guarantee Power Formula
```
IF you don't get [X RESULT] in [Y TIME], we will [Z CONSEQUENCE]
```

### The Math
```
Net Impact = (New Conv × (1-New Refund)) / (Old Conv × (1-Old Refund))
Target: > 1.0x
```

### Golden Rules
1. **Always address risk** - even if anti-guarantee
2. **Run the math** - don't be emotional
3. **Name it memorably** - never "satisfaction guarantee"
4. **Stack for power** - unconditional + conditional
5. **Tie conditions to success** - they achieve by complying
