## Pre-Work Checklist

### Before Using Any Angle

- [ ] Product/offer clearly defined
- [ ] Target avatar documented with exact language
- [ ] Awareness levels mapped for campaign
- [ ] Proof elements collected (testimonials, case studies, numbers)
- [ ] Read ad-angles-sop.md completely
- [ ] Understand relationship to hooks-sop.md and goated-ads-sop.md
- [ ] Testing infrastructure ready (ad platform, tracking, spreadsheet)

### Red Flags - STOP if:

## Angle Selection Checklist

### Step 1: Determine Awareness Level

| Level | Description | Check if Targeting |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 - Unaware | Doesn't know they have a problem | [ ] |
| 2 - Problem-Aware | Knows problem, not solutions | [ ] |
| 3 - Solution-Aware | Knows solutions exist, not your product | [ ] |
| 4 - Product-Aware | Knows your product, not convinced | [ ] |
| 5 - Most Aware | Knows product, ready to buy | [ ] |

### Step 2: Select Angle Category

**For Level 1-2 (Cold Traffic):**
- [ ] Rumors Are True (RT-01 to RT-06)
- [ ] Question Hooks (QH-01 to QH-04)
- [ ] Comparison 95% vs 5% (CC-07)

**For Level 3 (Warm Traffic):**
- [ ] Comparison/Contrast (CC-01 to CC-08)
- [ ] Systems/Framework (SF-01 to SF-06)
- [ ] Transformation (TR-01 to TR-06)

**For Level 4 (Warmer Traffic):**
- [ ] Book/Knowledge (BK-01 to BK-05)
- [ ] Transformation with Proof (TR-03, TR-04)

### Step 3: Apply 70-20-10 Rule

- [ ] 70% of angles from proven winners (your past data)
- [ ] 20% from adjacent categories (same awareness, different angle type)
- [ ] 10% completely new/experimental
