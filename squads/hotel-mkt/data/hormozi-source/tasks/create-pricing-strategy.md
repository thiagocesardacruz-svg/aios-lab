## Purpose
Create a pricing strategy based on value delivered, not cost or competition.

> "Price is what they pay. Value is what they get. Your job is to make value so obvious that price becomes irrelevant." — Alex Hormozi

## The Pricing Philosophy

### Anti-Commoditization Rules

1. **Never compete on price** — If you're the cheapest, you've already lost
2. **Price on value** — What is the result worth to them?
3. **Premium signals quality** — Low price = low perceived value
4. **Higher price = better clients** — They're more committed, easier to work with

### The Circle Virtuoso

```
Premium Price → Higher Commitment → Better Results
→ Better Clients → Higher Margins → Better Delivery
→ Justifies Premium Price
```

## Value-Based Pricing Framework

### Step 1: Calculate Value to Customer

```yaml
value_calculation:
  dream_outcome_value: ""  # What is achieving the result worth?
  time_saved_value: ""     # Time × hourly rate
  money_saved_value: ""    # Avoided costs
  money_made_value: ""     # Revenue generated
  emotional_value: ""      # Status, confidence, peace of mind

  total_value: ""          # Sum of all values
```

### Step 2: Apply the 10x Rule

Your price should be maximum 10% of the value delivered.
```
If Total Value = $100,000
Then Maximum Price = $10,000
```

### Step 3: Anchor and Stack

Build value stack that totals 10x+ your price:
```
Component 1: $X value
Component 2: $X value
Bonus 1: $X value
Bonus 2: $X value
---
Total Value: $100,000
Your Price: $10,000

They're getting 10x their investment.
```

## Pricing Tiers Strategy

### Why Offer Tiers

1. Different customers have different budgets
2. Upsell path built in
3. Decoy effect (middle tier sells best)
4. Higher-value clients self-select

### Three-Tier Structure

| Tier | Name | Price | Margin | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Basic | $X | Lower | Entry point, volume |
| 2 | Professional | $2-3X | Target | Main offer, best value |
| 3 | Premium | $5-10X | Highest | High-touch, maximum value |

### Decoy Pricing

Make middle tier the obvious choice:
- Basic: Missing key features
- Professional: All features, great value
- Premium: Same features + extras, much higher price

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Calculate Customer Value
What is the transformation worth to them?

### Step 2: Define Your Components
What do they get? Assign values to each.

### Step 3: Build the Stack
Ensure total value is 10x+ final price.

### Step 4: Create Tiers (Optional)
Design 2-3 tiers if appropriate.

### Step 5: Test Price Anchoring
Start higher, discount down — never start low.

### Step 6: Document Justification
Be able to explain why each component has its value.

## Price Presentation Script

```
"The total value of everything you're getting is [ANCHOR].

Most people in our situation would charge [COMPETITOR PRICE]
for just a fraction of this.

But because [REASON], you're not going to pay anything
close to that.

Your investment today is just [PRICE].

That means you're getting [X]x return on your investment
before you even start."
```

## Common Pricing Mistakes

1. **Pricing based on cost** — Your costs are irrelevant to customer value
2. **Pricing based on competitors** — You're not selling what they're selling
3. **Underpricing** — Signals low value, attracts bad clients
4. **Discounting without reason** — Trains customers to wait for sales
5. **Single price point** — Misses both high and low budget customers
