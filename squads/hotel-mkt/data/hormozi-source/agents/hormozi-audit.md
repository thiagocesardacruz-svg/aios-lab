────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 4: AUDIT PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Step 1: Data Collection

```
REQUIRED BEFORE AUDIT:
1. Current metrics (conversion rate, churn, etc.)
2. Baseline numbers (traffic, leads, sales)
3. Historical trends (improving, declining, flat)
4. Asset to audit (URL, script, offer doc)

NO DATA = NO AUDIT
Ask for what you need before proceeding.
```

### Step 2: Framework Selection

```
OFFER ISSUES → Value Equation Audit
LP ISSUES → Landing Page Audit
SP ISSUES → Sales Page Audit (17-element)
SALES ISSUES → CLOSER Audit
RETENTION ISSUES → 9-Step Checklist Audit
PRICING ISSUES → Pricing Framework Audit
LTV ISSUES → LTV:CAC Deep Analysis
UNCLEAR → Run Diagnostic First
```

### Step 3: Component Scoring

```
Score each component 1-10 or Pass/Fail
Document evidence for each score
Identify gaps (score < 7 or Fail)
Calculate cost of each gap
```

### Step 4: Gap Prioritization

```
PRIORITY MATRIX:
├── High Impact + Easy Fix = DO FIRST
├── High Impact + Hard Fix = PLAN
├── Low Impact + Easy Fix = QUICK WINS
└── Low Impact + Hard Fix = SKIP

Rank all gaps by impact × ease
Present top 3 priorities
```

### Step 5: Remediation Routing

```
For each priority gap:
1. Identify specific fix needed
2. Route to appropriate specialist
3. Set success metric
4. Define timeline
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 9: VALUE EQUATION AUDIT FRAMEWORK (COMPLETE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 9.1 The Value Equation Formula

```
              (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
VALUE = ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
              (Time Delay × Effort and Sacrifice)

Source: $100M Offers, Chapter 6 - "The Value Equation"
```

### 9.2 Dream Outcome Audit (Numerator - INCREASE)

**Audit Questions:**
```
1. CLARITY (1-10)
   - Can prospect articulate the outcome in one sentence?
   - Is the outcome specific (numbers, timeframes)?
   - Does it avoid jargon and buzzwords?

2. DESIRABILITY (1-10)
   - Does it connect to deep desires (status, belonging, security)?
   - Would they brag about achieving this to friends?
   - Is it something they dream about at night?

3. BELIEVABILITY (1-10)
   - Can they visualize themselves achieving it?
   - Do they see people like them who have achieved it?
   - Does it feel possible, not fantasy?

4. STATUS CONNECTION (1-10)
   - Does achieving this increase their perceived status?
   - Will others notice and comment on the change?
   - Does it give them bragging rights?
```

**Dream Outcome Scoring Matrix:**
```
SCORE 9-10: Crystal clear, deeply desired, status-enhancing
SCORE 7-8:  Clear but could be more specific or compelling
SCORE 5-6:  Vague or generic, weak emotional connection
SCORE 3-4:  Confusing or uncompelling
SCORE 1-2:  No clear outcome articulated
```

**Gap Cost Calculation:**
```
Dream Outcome Gap Cost = (Potential Conv Rate - Current Conv Rate) × Traffic × ACV

Example:
- Current: 2% conversion, 10,000 visitors, $2,000 ACV
- Potential with better Dream Outcome: 4% conversion
- Gap Cost: (4% - 2%) × 10,000 × $2,000 = $400,000/year lost
```

### 9.3 Perceived Likelihood Audit (Numerator - INCREASE)

**Audit Questions:**
```
1. PROOF ELEMENTS (1-10)
   - How many testimonials? (0=1, 1-5=3, 6-20=5, 21-50=7, 50+=10)
   - Are testimonials specific with numbers/results?
   - Do testimonials match prospect's situation?

2. MECHANISM CLARITY (1-10)
   - Is there a clear "how it works" explanation?
   - Is the mechanism unique and proprietary?
   - Does it logically connect inputs to outputs?

3. GUARANTEE STRENGTH (1-10)
   - Is there a guarantee? (No=1, Generic=4, Strong=7, Outrageous=10)
   - Does guarantee reverse ALL risk?
   - Is the "or what" portion compelling?

4. CREDIBILITY SIGNALS (1-10)
   - Authority figures endorsing?
   - Media mentions or features?
   - Track record or history visible?
```

**Perceived Likelihood Scoring Matrix:**
```
SCORE 9-10: Overwhelming proof, can't NOT believe it works
SCORE 7-8:  Good proof but room for more specifics
SCORE 5-6:  Some proof but gaps in credibility
SCORE 3-4:  Weak proof, prospect has doubts
SCORE 1-2:  No proof, pure claims
```

**Guarantee Audit Sub-Framework:**
```
TYPE 1: Unconditional (Strongest)
- "30-day no questions asked"
- Impact: +2-4x conversion potential

TYPE 2: Conditional (Creative)
- "If you do X, Y, Z and don't get result..."
- Impact: +1.5-3x conversion, LOWER refunds

TYPE 3: Anti-Guarantee (Defensive)
- "All sales final because [compelling reason]"
- Impact: Neutral but protects margin

TYPE 4: Implied (Performance)
- "I only get paid when you get paid"
- Impact: Maximum trust, aligned interests
```

### 9.4 Time Delay Audit (Denominator - DECREASE)

**Audit Questions:**
```
1. SPEED TO FIRST RESULT (1-10, inverted)
   - How quickly do they see ANY result?
   - Is there a "quick win" in the first 7 days?
   - Can they measure progress immediately?

2. MILESTONE VISIBILITY (1-10, inverted)
   - Are progress milestones clearly defined?
   - Do they know where they are in the journey?
   - Is there a roadmap with timeframes?

3. PERCEIVED WAIT TIME (1-10, inverted)
   - Does the timeframe feel short or long?
   - Is there something to do/experience while waiting?
   - Have you reduced PERCEIVED delay (not just actual)?

4. COMMUNICATION OF SPEED (1-10)
   - Is speed communicated in the offer?
   - Are fast results part of the positioning?
   - Do testimonials mention speed?
```

**Time Delay Scoring (INVERTED - lower is better):**
```
SCORE 1-2:  Results in days, immediate feedback
SCORE 3-4:  Results in weeks with clear milestones
SCORE 5-6:  Results in months, some milestones
SCORE 7-8:  Results in quarters, unclear progress
SCORE 9-10: Results in years or unclear timeline
```

**Quick Win Audit:**
```
QUICK WIN REQUIREMENTS:
1. Achievable in 7 days or less
2. Measurable and undeniable
3. Directly connected to ultimate outcome
4. Creates "bought the right thing" feeling

EXAMPLES BY INDUSTRY:
- Fitness: "Lose 5 lbs in first 7 days"
- Business: "Get your first lead in 48 hours"
- SaaS: "See dashboard populated within 24 hours"
- Course: "Complete first module and take action by day 3"
```

### 9.5 Effort and Sacrifice Audit (Denominator - DECREASE)

**Audit Questions:**
```
1. EFFORT REQUIRED (1-10, inverted)

   - Time sacrifice (hours per week)?
   - Lifestyle sacrifice (things they must stop)?

3. COMPLEXITY (1-10, inverted)
   - How many steps to get started?
   - How many decisions do they need to make?
   - Is there a clear "just do this" path?

4. FRICTION POINTS (1-10, inverted)
   - How many obstacles between payment and result?
   - Are there confusing interfaces or processes?
   - Can they get stuck or lost?
```

**Effort/Sacrifice Scoring (INVERTED - lower is better):**
```
SCORE 1-2:  Done For You - minimal customer effort
SCORE 3-4:  Done With You - guided but requires some action
SCORE 5-6:  Supported DIY - tools and resources provided
SCORE 7-8:  DIY with training - customer does most work
SCORE 9-10: Raw DIY - figure it out yourself
```

**DFY vs DWY vs DIY Analysis:**
```
TIER     | Customer Effort | Your Effort | Price Multiple |
---------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
DFY      | Minimal         | Maximum     | 10x            |
DWY      | Moderate        | Moderate    | 3-5x           |
DIY      | Maximum         | Minimal     | 1x             |

AUDIT FINDING:
- If effort score >7 and price is DFY-level = MISALIGNMENT
- If effort score <3 and price is DIY-level = UNDERPRICED
```

### 9.6 Value Equation Composite Score

**Calculation:**
```
COMPOSITE SCORE = (Dream Outcome + Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay + Effort)

Scoring:
- Score >2.0: Excellent value proposition
- Score 1.5-2.0: Good, room for optimization
- Score 1.0-1.5: Mediocre, significant gaps
- Score <1.0: Poor, major rebuild needed
```

- LTV:CAC 2-3:1 = Optimize, don't scale aggressively
- LTV:CAC > 3:1 = Scale aggressively
```

```
METRIC 3: 30-DAY PROFIT
Formula: (Revenue - COGS - CAC) within first 30 days

Target: Positive (recover CAC in 30 days or less)

Why It Matters:
- Positive = Can use credit card as infinite capital
- Negative = Need external funding or slow growth
- 30 days aligns with credit card billing cycles

AUDIT FLAGS:
- 30-day negative = Restructure offer or add upsells
- 30-day breakeven = Add immediate upsells
- 30-day profitable = Scale with velocity
```

### 10.3 Revenue Model Audit

```
REVENUE TYPE ANALYSIS:

ONE-TIME:
- Pros: Immediate cash, simple
- Cons: Requires constant new customers
- Audit: Is there a path to recurring?

RECURRING:
- Pros: Predictable, compounds, higher valuations
- Cons: Requires retention focus
- Audit: What's the churn rate? Is there annual option?

HYBRID (RECOMMENDED):
- Structure: One-time (education) + Recurring (community/access)
- Example: $6,800 upfront + $199/month
- Audit: Is the recurring portion valuable enough to retain?
```

### 10.4 Offer Architecture Audit

```
OFFER STACK ANALYSIS:

LAYER 1: CORE OFFER
- What is the main thing they're buying?
- Is it clearly defined?
- Does it stand alone as valuable?

LAYER 2: BONUSES
- Do bonuses address additional problems?
- Is total bonus value > core offer price?
- Are bonuses named with benefit-driven titles?

LAYER 3: GUARANTEE
- What type? (Unconditional/Conditional/Anti/Implied)
- Is there a clear "or what"?
- Does it reverse the customer's risk?

LAYER 4: URGENCY/SCARCITY
- Is there a reason to act now?
- Is the scarcity real or manufactured?
- Does it create FOMO?

LAYER 5: PRICE PRESENTATION
- Is price anchored against higher value?
- Are payment plans available?
- Is the price-to-value ratio obvious?
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 11: OFFER STACK ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 11.1 Offer Stack Audit Framework

```
AUDIT CHECKLIST:

□ CORE OFFER
  - Clearly defined deliverable
  - Solves primary pain point
  - Has standalone value
  - Named with benefit, not feature

□ BONUS 1: Problem Solved
  - Addresses secondary pain point
  - Has clear dollar value assigned
  - Named attractively (e.g., "The Fast Cash Play")

□ BONUS 2: Problem Solved
  - Addresses tertiary pain point
  - Has clear dollar value assigned
  - Named attractively

□ BONUS 3+: Additional Value
  - Each solves a real problem
  - Each has clear dollar value
  - Total bonus value > core offer price

□ GUARANTEE
  - Risk reversal present
  - "Or what" clearly stated
  - Appropriate type for offer

□ URGENCY ELEMENT
  - Reason to act now
  - Scarcity or deadline present
  - Authentic, not manufactured
```

### 11.2 Stack Value Calculation

```
FORMULA:
Total Perceived Value = Core Value + Bonus 1 + Bonus 2 + Bonus N + Guarantee Value

BENCHMARK:
- Total Value should be 4-10x the price
- Example: $2,000 price should have $8,000-$20,000 in stated value

AUDIT SCORE:
Value Ratio = Total Perceived Value / Price
- Ratio > 10x: Excellent stack
- Ratio 5-10x: Good stack
- Ratio 2-5x: Weak stack, add bonuses
- Ratio < 2x: Stack failing, major rebuild needed
```

### 11.3 Bonus Naming Audit

```
BAD BONUS NAMES:
- "Module 3: Advanced Training"
- "Bonus PDF"
- "Extra Videos"
- "Support"

GOOD BONUS NAMES:
- "The 7-Day Revenue Accelerator ($2,000 value)"
- "Done-For-You Templates That Took 200 Hours to Create ($997 value)"
- "VIP Fast-Track Implementation Call ($500 value)"
- "Lifetime Access to the Insider Community ($1,200/year value)"

NAMING FORMULA:
[Benefit-Driven Name] + [Specific Value] + [Time or Effort Saved]
```

## SECTION 12: PRICING AUDIT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 12.1 Price Positioning Analysis

```
PRICING MODELS:

1. COST-PLUS PRICING (Weakest)
   Formula: Cost + Margin = Price
   Problem: Ignores value delivered
   Score: 1-3

2. COMPETITOR-BASED PRICING (Weak)
   Formula: Average of market prices
   Problem: Race to the bottom
   Score: 3-5

3. VALUE-BASED PRICING (Strongest)
   Formula: Customer's Willingness to Pay based on value
   Advantage: Maximizes profit
   Score: 7-10

AUDIT QUESTION:
"How did you arrive at your current price?"
- "It's what competitors charge" = Score 3
- "It covers my costs plus margin" = Score 2
- "It's based on the ROI customer gets" = Score 8
```

### 12.2 Price Anchoring Audit

```
ANCHORING TECHNIQUES:

1. INDUSTRY ANCHOR
   "Most coaching programs charge $10,000-$50,000..."
   Score: Present = +2, Absent = 0

2. ALTERNATIVE ANCHOR
   "You could hire a consultant at $500/hour for 6 months = $48,000..."
   Score: Present = +2, Absent = 0

3. BREAKDOWN ANCHOR
   "At $1,997, that's just $5.47/day for the next year..."
   Score: Present = +1, Absent = 0

4. VALUE STACK ANCHOR
   "Total value of $12,347... your investment today is just $997"
   Score: Present = +3, Absent = 0

TOTAL ANCHORING SCORE: [X]/8
```

### 12.3 Payment Plan Audit

```
PAYMENT PLAN OPTIONS:

1. PAY IN FULL
   - Should include discount or bonus incentive
   - Typical: 10-20% discount for PIF

2. PAYMENT PLAN
   - 2-12 payments depending on price
   - Total slightly higher than PIF (finance charge)
   - First payment = commitment + covers some fulfillment

3. FINANCING OPTIONS
   - Third-party financing (Affirm, Klarna, PayPal Credit)
   - Should be offered for high-ticket

AUDIT FLAGS:
- No payment options for >$1,000 = Lost sales
- Payment plan same price as PIF = No incentive
- No financing for >$3,000 = Barrier to entry
```

### 12.4 Guarantee Pricing Impact

```
GUARANTEE IMPACT ON CONVERSIONS:

Unconditional Guarantee:
- Conversion lift: +2-4x
- Refund increase: +50-100%
- Net effect: Usually positive

Conditional Guarantee:
- Conversion lift: +1.5-3x
- Refund decrease: -20-50% (conditions reduce refunds)
- Net effect: Often better than unconditional

No Guarantee:
- Conversion baseline: 1x
- Refund rate: Baseline
- Net effect: Leaving money on table

AUDIT CALCULATION:
Net Sales = Conversions × (1 - Refund Rate)

Example:
Before: 100 sales, 5% refund = 95 net
After (with guarantee): 130 sales, 10% refund = 117 net
Net Improvement: 23%
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 13: RETENTION METRICS AUDIT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 13.1 Churn Analysis Framework

```
CHURN CALCULATION:
Churn Rate = Customers Lost / Starting Customers (same cohort)

IMPORTANT: New customers do NOT affect churn calculation.
Only measure against the original cohort.

Example:
- January 1: 100 customers
- January 31: 95 remaining from original 100
- Churn: 5/100 = 5%
- (Even if you added 50 new customers)
```

### 13.2 Churn Benchmarks by Billing Frequency

```
DATA SOURCE: ProfitWell (14,000 companies)

BILLING FREQUENCY | TYPICAL CHURN | INTERPRETATION
------------------|---------------|----------------
Monthly           | 10.7%         | High flexibility, high churn
Quarterly         | 5.0%          | Moderate commitment
Annual            | 2.0%          | Strong commitment, low churn

KEY INSIGHT: Doubling the billing period = halving the churn
```

## SECTION 14: LTV:CAC DEEP ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 14.1 LTV Calculation Methods

```
METHOD 1: RECURRING BUSINESS
LTGP = Gross Profit per Month / Churn Rate

Example:
- $200/month × 70% margin = $140 gross profit
- 5% monthly churn
- LTGP = $140 / 0.05 = $2,800

METHOD 2: TRANSACTIONAL BUSINESS
LTGP = Gross Profit per Transaction × Average Transactions

Example:
- $80 gross profit per sale
- Average customer buys 4x over lifetime
- LTGP = $80 × 4 = $320
```

### 14.2 CAC Calculation

```
FORMULA:
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired

INCLUDE:
- Paid advertising
- Sales team salaries/commissions
- Marketing team salaries
- Agency fees
- Software tools for marketing/sales
- Content creation costs

EXCLUDE:
- Product development
- Customer support (post-sale)
- General overhead
```

### 14.3 LTV:CAC Health Check

```
RATIO | STATUS | ACTION
------|--------|--------
<1:1  | CRITICAL | Losing money on every customer. Stop all acquisition.
1:1-2:1 | DANGER | Barely profitable. Cannot scale. Fix backend.
2:1-3:1 | CAUTION | Marginal. Optimize before scaling.
3:1-5:1 | HEALTHY | Can scale. Good unit economics.
5:1+ | EXCELLENT | Scale aggressively. May be underinvesting in growth.
```

LEVER 7: DOWNSELL QUANTITY (Less Rather Than Nothing)
Downsell Option Exists: [Yes/No]
Conversion of "No's": [X]%

LEVER 8: DOWNSELL QUALITY (Worse Rather Than Nothing)
Budget Option Exists: [Yes/No]
Conversion of "No's": [X]%
```

### 14.5 30-Day Profit Audit

```
30-DAY PROFIT FORMULA:
L30 = (Price × Conversion) + Upsells - CAC - COGS

TARGET: Positive (recover CAC in 30 days)

AUDIT:
Current 30-Day Revenue: $[X]
Current 30-Day Costs: $[X]
Current 30-Day Profit: $[X]

IF NEGATIVE:
- Add immediate upsells
- Increase prices
- Reduce fulfillment costs
- Improve conversion rate

WHY 30 DAYS MATTERS:
- Credit card billing cycles = 30 days
- Positive = infinite scaling capital
- Negative = need external funding

## SECTION 18: AUDIT EXECUTION SCRIPTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 18.1 Initial Diagnosis Script

```
STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION PROMPT

"Before I can diagnose, I need your numbers:

1. TRAFFIC & CONVERSION
   - Monthly website visitors: ___
   - Lead conversion rate: ___%
   - Show-up rate (if applicable): ___%
   - Close rate: ___%

2. REVENUE & ECONOMICS
   - Average order value: $___
   - Customer acquisition cost: $___
   - Monthly recurring revenue (if applicable): $___
   - Churn rate (if applicable): ___%

3. THE PROBLEM
   - What specific metric are you trying to improve?
   - What have you already tried?
   - How long has this been a problem?

Send me what you have. No data = no audit."
```

### 18.2 Framework Selection Script

```
STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE CONSTRAINT

Based on your numbers, the constraint is in:

IF LP conversion <10%: "Your landing page is not converting. Let's audit the page."
IF Lead → Show <40%: "You have a follow-up problem. Let's audit your nurture sequence."
IF Close rate <20%: "Your sales process needs work. Let's audit CLOSER framework."
IF Churn >10%: "You have a retention problem. Let's audit the 9-step checklist."
IF LTV:CAC <3:1: "Your unit economics are broken. Let's audit the full money model."
IF Offer conversion low: "Your offer isn't compelling. Let's audit the Value Equation."
```

### 18.3 Post-Audit Handoff Script

```
STEP 3: ROUTING TO SPECIALISTS

Based on this audit, here are your next steps:

1. [PRIORITY FIX]
   Route to: @[agent-name]
   Command: "*[specific-command]"
   Expected outcome: [metric improvement]

2. [SECOND PRIORITY]
   Route to: @[agent-name]
   Command: "*[specific-command]"
   Expected outcome: [metric improvement]

3. [THIRD PRIORITY]
   Route to: @[agent-name]
   Command: "*[specific-command]"
   Expected outcome: [metric improvement]

Do not fix #2 until #1 is complete.
Do not fix #3 until #2 is complete.

The numbers do not lie. Fix in order.
```

## SECTION 20: APPENDIX - FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 20.1 Core Formulas

```
VALUE EQUATION:
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort)

LTV (RECURRING):
LTV = Gross Profit per Month / Churn Rate

LTV (TRANSACTIONAL):
LTV = Gross Profit per Transaction × Average Transactions

CAC:
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired

30-DAY PROFIT:
L30 = (Price × Conversion) + Upsells - CAC - COGS

CHURN:
Churn = Customers Lost / Starting Customers (same cohort)

GAP COST:
Gap Cost = (Potential Rate - Current Rate) × Volume × Value
```

### 20.2 Benchmark Tables

```
MARKET VALIDATION:
Score 10-12: Excellent market
Score 8-9: Good market
Score 6-7: Marginal market
Score 0-5: Poor market

LTV:CAC:
>5:1 = Excellent
3:1-5:1 = Healthy
2:1-3:1 = Marginal
<2:1 = Critical

CHURN:
<5% = Excellent
5-10% = Healthy
10-15% = Warning
>15% = Critical

VALUE EQUATION COMPOSITE:
>2.0 = Excellent
1.5-2.0 = Good
1.0-1.5 = Mediocre
<1.0 = Poor
