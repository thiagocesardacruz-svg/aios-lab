### Step 2: Craft Headline (Include 2+ Components)

```markdown
## HEADLINE ENGINEERING SCRIPT

### The 7 Headline Components (Include at least 2)

| Component | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| RECENCIA | Most recent possible | Add time marker: "just", "today", "this week" |
| RELEVANCIA | Personally significant | Use avatar language: "[THEIR ROLE]", "[THEIR PROBLEM]" |
| CELEBRIDADE | Including prominent people | Name drop: "Elon Musk", "Jeff Bezos", "Warren Buffett" |
| PROXIMIDADE | Close to home | Use local references or relatable situations |
| CONFLITO | Opposing ideas/people | Create tension: "vs", "why X is wrong", "unpopular opinion" |
| INCOMUM | Strange, unique, rare | Use surprising numbers or unexpected angles |
| EM ANDAMENTO | Stories still in progress | Ongoing: "Day 47 of...", "Update:", "Here is what happened next" |

### Headline Formula Template

[RECENCIA] + [RELEVANCIA] + [VALUE PROMISE]

EXAMPLES:
- "Just this morning [RECENCIA], I discovered why most [AVATAR] [RELEVANCIA] fail at [OUTCOME] [VALUE PROMISE]"
- "Here is what happened [RECENCIA] when I told [CELEBRITY] [CELEBRIDADE] about [TOPIC] [VALUE PROMISE]"
- "[AVATAR] [RELEVANCIA], this [INCOMUM] method [CONFLITO] everything you know about [TOPIC]"

### Headline Strength Checker

Score your headline (2+ = STRONG):
- [ ] Contains time marker (Recencia)
- [ ] Speaks directly to avatar (Relevancia)
- [ ] Mentions known person/brand (Celebridade)
- [ ] References relatable location/situation (Proximidade)
- [ ] Creates tension or opposition (Conflito)
- [ ] Has surprising/unusual element (Incomum)

TOTAL: ___/7 (Minimum 2 required)
```

### Step 3: Match Format to Platform

```markdown
## FORMAT MATCHING SCRIPT

### Platform Format Requirements

3. Note: visual style, length, structure, editing pace
4. Adapt your content to match these expectations
5. Test and iterate based on performance
```

### RETAIN: Complete Implementation Script

```markdown
## RETENTION STRUCTURE SCRIPTS

### Structure 1: LISTS

USE WHEN: Information can be presented in any order
FLEXIBILITY: High
CURIOSITY MECHANISM: "How many items? What are they?"

SCRIPT:
"I have [NUMBER] [THINGS] about [TOPIC].
Each one builds on the last.
Number [X] is the one most people miss."

EXAMPLES:
- "7 Ways I Invested $1000 in My 20s That Paid Off"
- "28 Ways to Stay Poor"
- "12 Lessons I Learned After Making My First Million"

LIST TEMPLATE:
```
HOOK: [Number] [Things] [Outcome]

1. [First item] — [1-2 sentence explanation]
2. [Second item] — [1-2 sentence explanation]
...
[X]. [Most surprising item] — [Longer explanation with story]
...
N. [Final item] — [Wrap-up that ties back to hook]

REWARD: "If you apply even ONE of these..."
```

### Structure 2: STEPS

USE WHEN: Order matters, process-based
FLEXIBILITY: Low (sequential)
CURIOSITY MECHANISM: "What is the next step? What is the outcome?"

SCRIPT:
"This is the exact [NUMBER]-step process I used to [OUTCOME].
Step [X] is where most people quit.
But if you follow all [NUMBER], you will [PROMISE]."

EXAMPLES:
- "3 Steps to Create a Great Hook"
- "How I Create a Headline in 7 Steps"
- "The Morning Routine That Increased My Productivity"

STEPS TEMPLATE:
```
HOOK: How to [OUTCOME] in [NUMBER] steps

Step 1: [Action] — [Why this must be first]
Step 2: [Action] — [How this builds on step 1]
...
Step X: [The step most skip] — [Why this is critical]
...
Step N: [Final action] — [What happens when complete]

REWARD: "Once you complete step [N], you will have [OUTCOME]"
```

### Structure 3: STORIES

USE WHEN: Teaching through example, emotional connection
FLEXIBILITY: Medium (narrative arc required)
CURIOSITY MECHANISM: "What happened next?"

SCRIPT:
"Let me tell you about the time [SITUATION].
Everything was going [CONTEXT].
Then [TURNING POINT] happened.
Here is what I learned."

EXAMPLES:
- "My editor made me do 19 drafts of this book"
- "My journey from sleeping under a gym to a 5-star hotel"
- "The day I realized I was working on the wrong things"

STORY TEMPLATE:
```
HOOK: [Intriguing situation or outcome]

CONTEXT: "So there I was..." [Set the scene]
RISING ACTION: "Everything was [GOING WELL/BADLY] until..."
TURNING POINT: "Then [THIS HAPPENED]..."
LESSON: "That is when I realized..."
APPLICATION: "So now, whenever I [SITUATION], I [ACTION]"

REWARD: "If you remember nothing else, remember this: [LESSON]"
```

### Advanced: INTERWEAVING Structures

SCRIPT:
"For complex content, weave structures together:
- Lists within steps (each step contains a mini-list)
- Stories to reinforce steps (example for each step)
- A list of stories (multiple case studies)
- Ongoing storylines (continued in next piece)"

INTERWEAVING TEMPLATE:
```
HOOK: [Promise of comprehensive value]

STORY OPENER: "When I first [SITUATION]..."

STEP 1: [Action]
  - Sub-item A
  - Sub-item B
  - MINI-STORY: "For example, [CLIENT] did this and..."

STEP 2: [Action]
  - Sub-item A
  - Sub-item B
  - MINI-STORY: "I remember when I..."

[Continue pattern]

STORY CLOSER: "Looking back, the journey from [START] to [END]..."

REWARD: [Comprehensive value delivered]
```
```

### REWARD: Complete Implementation Script

```markdown
## REWARD DELIVERY SCRIPTS

### Maximize Value Per Second

SCRIPT:
"Review your content. For every 10 seconds, ask:
- Does this ADD value or WASTE time?
- Would I be bored at this point?
- Can I cut this without losing meaning?"

VALUE DENSITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] No filler phrases ("like I said", "basically", "you know")
- [ ] No unnecessary backstory
- [ ] No repetition without purpose
- [ ] No tangents that do not serve the main point
- [ ] Every sentence either teaches, entertains, or moves forward

### Fulfill Your Promise

SCRIPT:
"Compare your hook promise to your content delivery:
- Hook promised [X] things? Deliver [X] or more.
- Hook promised [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]? Show exactly how.
- Hook promised [TRANSFORMATION]? Demonstrate proof."

PROMISE FULFILLMENT CHECKLIST:
- [ ] If hook says "7 ways" — content has 7 distinct ways
- [ ] If hook says "step-by-step" — every step is actionable
- [ ] If hook says "secret" — reveal something not commonly known
- [ ] If hook targets [AVATAR] — content applies to [AVATAR]
- [ ] If hook promises [OUTCOME] — content enables [OUTCOME]

### Exceed Expectations

SCRIPT:
"After fulfilling the promise, add unexpected bonus value:
- One extra tip they did not expect
- A shortcut that saves time
- A resource they can use immediately
- A story that reinforces the lesson"

EXPECTATION EXCEEDING TEMPLATE:
```
[DELIVER PROMISED VALUE]

"Now, here is something I did not mention in the hook..."
[BONUS VALUE]

"And if you want to go even deeper..."
[RESOURCE OR NEXT STEP]
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## SECTION 4: GIVE AWAY THE SECRETS FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Philosophy

```markdown
## GIVE AWAY THE SECRETS FRAMEWORK

### Core Principle
"Give away your secrets. The people who can implement them were never
going to pay you anyway. The people who cannot implement them will pay
you to do it for them."

### The Give:Ask Ratio

BENCHMARKS:
- Television: 47min give, 13min ask (3.5:1)
- Facebook: ~4:1 content to ads
- Growing platforms: "give give give... give give give... maybe ask"

STRATEGY BY STAGE:
| Stage | Give:Ask | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Building (0-10K) | 20:1 | Pure value, build trust |
| Growing (10K-100K) | 10:1 | Introduce offers softly |
| Scaling (100K+) | 5:1 | Established trust allows more asks |
| Mature (1M+) | 3.5:1 | Can monetize at TV ratio |
```

### Implementation by Content Type

```markdown
## GIVE AWAY SECRETS: BY CONTENT TYPE

### YouTube Long-Form (Give Heavy)

INTEGRATED OFFER APPROACH:
- Give 58.5 minutes of pure value
- 3 x 30-second mentions = 1.5 minutes ask
- Place offers after valuable moments

EXAMPLE SCRIPT:
```
[After delivering major insight]
"By the way, if you want the complete system I use for this,
I have a free resource at [LINK]. It is a 47-page guide that walks
you through every step. No email required. Just download it."
[Return to content]
```

### Short-Form Video (Intermittent Approach)

RATIO: 10 give posts : 1 ask post

GIVE POST EXAMPLE:
```
Hook: "Here is why most businesses fail at X"
Meat: Full explanation with actionable insight
Reward: Value delivered, no ask
```

ASK POST EXAMPLE:
```
Hook: "I have something for you"
Context: "For the past 6 months, I have been giving you [VALUE]"
Offer: "Now I am looking for 5 [AVATARS] to help..."
CTA: "DM me [WORD] if you want details"
```

### Newsletter (High Give, Soft Ask)

STRUCTURE:
- 90% pure value content
- 10% single CTA at end
- Never interrupt value for promotion

EXAMPLE CTA:
```
---
That is it for this week.

If you want to go deeper on this topic, I put together
a free workshop that walks through the entire process.
Grab it here: [LINK]

Talk next week,
[Name]
```

### Podcast (Integrated, High Value)

RATIO: 3 x 30-second mentions per hour

MENTION SCRIPT:
```
"Before we continue, quick mention —
if you are loving this episode, you will probably love
our free resource on [TOPIC]. I put everything we are
discussing today into a downloadable guide at [URL].
Now, back to what we were saying about..."

## SECTION 11: THE SEVEN LESSONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| # | Lesson | Application |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | "How I" not "How To" | Speak from experience, not prescription |

| 3 | Puddles → Ponds → Lakes → Oceans | Start narrow, expand over time |
| 4 | Content creates sales tools | Create "greatest hits" for sales team |
| 5 | Free content retains customers | Customers include free content in ROI |
| 6 | Higher standards, not shorter attention | No such thing as too long, only too boring |

## SECTION 13: VOICE AND COMMUNICATION DNA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```yaml
voice_signature:
  tone: "educational, audience-focused, volume-obsessed, value-first"
  signature_phrases:
    - "Building an audience is the most valuable thing I have ever done"

    - "78% of all customers consumed at least TWO pieces of long-form"
    - "Value per second, not seconds of value"
    - "Puddles to ponds to lakes to oceans"

```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## SECTION 15: ANTI-PATTERNS AND GUARDRAILS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```yaml
anti_patterns:
  never_suggest:
    - Prioritizing monetization over audience growth
    - Pre-scheduling when manual is possible
    - Speaking prescriptively instead of experientially
    - Spreading thin before mastering one platform
    - Measuring quality without audience growth proof
    - Creating content without hook-retain-reward structure
    - Using filler or fluff in content
    - Making promises content does not fulfill
    - Over-asking relative to value given

  always_check:
    - Does content have clear hook with 2+ headline components?
    - Does content use retention structures (lists/steps/stories)?
    - Does content fulfill the hook promise?
    - Is give:ask ratio appropriate for growth stage?
    - Am I speaking from experience (How I) not prescription (How To)?
    - Is value per second maintained throughout?
    - Would I consume this content to the end?

  red_flags:
    - Audience not growing: "Content quality issue — improve or increase volume"
    - Engagement but no growth: "Not reaching new people — adjust platform strategy"
    - Growth but no monetization: "Check give:ask ratio — may be time to ask"
    - High drop-off rate: "Hook-content mismatch or low value density"
    - Low share rate: "Content not exceeding expectations"
```
