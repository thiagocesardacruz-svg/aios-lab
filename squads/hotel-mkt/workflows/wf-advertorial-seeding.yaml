          Subject: Guest Post Idea: The Rise of Workation-Friendly Hotels in Brazil

          Hi [Editor Name],

          I loved your recent piece on remote work trends in Brazilian travel. As someone who's been adapting our boutique hotel for the workation boom, I thought you might be interested in a follow-up angle.

          I'd like to pitch a guest post: "5 Signs a Hotel Truly Gets the Workation Traveler" – practical tips for readers planning workcations, based on what we've learned serving 200+ remote workers in the past year.

          It would include actionable advice (what to look for, questions to ask) rather than promotion. I can include [Hotel Name] as a case study, but the focus would be helping your readers plan better workations.

          Would this fit your editorial calendar? Happy to send a draft or outline.

          Best,
          [Name]

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RISKS & MITIGATION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

risks:
  - risk: "Low pitch acceptance rate (organic PR)"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Focus on genuine value, personalize pitches, build editor relationships over time"

  - risk: "High cost of paid placements"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Negotiate discounts, bundle placements, focus on high-ROI publications"

  - risk: "Poor referral traffic or conversions"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Optimize landing pages, use compelling CTAs in articles, track and iterate"

  - risk: "Backlinks become nofollow or removed"
    impact: "Low"
    mitigation: "Negotiate dofollow in advance, maintain relationships with publications"

  - risk: "Brand mentions are negative (Media Multiplier backfires)"
    impact: "Low"
    mitigation: "Monitor mentions closely, respond quickly to negative sentiment, focus on quality content"

  - risk: "Content is too promotional (rejected or poor performance)"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Follow 80-20 rule (80% value, 20% hotel), get editor feedback before submission"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# NOTES & BEST PRACTICES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

notes:
  - "Hormozi principle: Volume wins. Pitch 50 to land 10. Consistency beats perfection."
  - "Conley principle: Story sells. Don't pitch features, pitch narratives and human experiences."
  - "Schrager principle: Media Multiplier Effect. One great placement generates 3+ secondary mentions. Target Tier 1 publications for maximum multiplier."
  - "Value-first approach: 80% reader value, 20% hotel mention. Editors smell promotion from a mile away."
  - "Build relationships, not one-off placements. Invest in long-term editor relationships."
  - "Editorial placements have compounding value: backlinks improve SEO over time, articles remain live for years."
  - "Track everything: referrals, bookings, backlinks, brand searches. What gets measured gets improved."
  - "Media Multiplier in action: One Vogue feature → design blogs → Instagram influencers → local magazines → tourism boards. Aim for 3x minimum."
  - "Paid placements are faster but organic PR is more credible. Balance both."
  - "Repurpose published articles across hotel's own channels (blog, social, email) for maximum ROI."
