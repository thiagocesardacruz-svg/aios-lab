## Growth Waves Framework

A "wave" is a coordinated growth push:
1. **Hypothesis**: What we believe will drive growth
2. **Lever**: Which AARRR stage we're targeting
3. **Experiments**: 3-5 tests to validate
4. **Metrics**: How we measure success
5. **Timeline**: 2-4 week sprint

## ICE Prioritization

| Initiative | Impact | Confidence | Ease | Score |
|------------|--------|------------|------|-------|
| Example 1 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 7.0 |
| Example 2 | 6 | 8 | 9 | 7.7 |
