# Consolidate Patterns Using Intelligent Clustering

> Task ID: brad-consolidate-patterns
> Agent: Brad (Design System Architect)
> Version: 1.0.0

## Description

Reduce UI pattern redundancy by clustering similar patterns using intelligent algorithms (HSL color clustering at 5% threshold, semantic button grouping). Target: >80% reduction.

## Prerequisites

- Audit completed (*audit command run successfully)
- .state.yaml exists with inventory results
- pattern-inventory.json available

## Workflow

### Interactive Elicitation

This task uses interactive elicitation to review consolidation decisions.

1. **Load Audit Results**
   - Read .state.yaml to get inventory data
   - Display current redundancy metrics
   - Confirm user wants to proceed with consolidation

2. **Review Clustering Parameters**
   - HSL threshold for colors (default: 5%)
   - Ask if user has manual overrides (patterns that shouldn't merge)
   - Confirm output directory

3. **Present Consolidation Recommendations**
   - Show before/after for each pattern type
   - Ask for approval or adjustments
   - Allow manual overrides before finalizing

### Steps

1. **Load Audit Data**
   - Read .state.yaml for inventory results
   - Validate audit phase completed
   - Extract pattern counts and scan path
   - Validation: State file exists and contains inventory data

2. **Cluster Colors by HSL Similarity**
   - Extract all unique colors from codebase
   - Convert hex to HSL color space
   - Group colors within 5% HSL threshold
   - Select most-used color in each cluster as primary
   - Identify semantic relationships (primary-dark as hover state)
   - Validation: Color clusters created with usage counts

3. **Cluster Button Patterns by Semantic Purpose**
   - Extract button class names and patterns
   - Analyze naming for semantic meaning (primary, secondary, danger, etc)
   - Group functionally equivalent buttons
   - Recommend minimal variant set (primary, secondary, destructive)
   - Validation: Button consolidation map created

4. **Consolidate Spacing Values**
   - Extract all padding and margin values
   - Identify base unit (4px or 8px)
   - Propose spacing scale (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl)
   - Map existing values to scale
   - Validation: Spacing scale generated

5. **Consolidate Typography**
   - Extract font sizes, weights, families
   - Propose type scale (modular scale or fixed intervals)
   - Consolidate similar weights (merge 500 and 600 if both exist)
   - Recommend minimal font family set
   - Validation: Typography scale created

6. **Generate Consolidation Report**
   - Create consolidation-report.md with before/after metrics
   - Include reduction percentages for each pattern type
   - Generate detailed cluster files (color-clusters.txt, button-consolidation.txt)
   - Calculate overall reduction percentage
   - Validation: Report shows >80% reduction or explain why not

7. **Create Pattern Mapping**
   - Generate old-to-new mapping for each pattern type
   - Document which old patterns map to which new tokens
   - Create migration guide snippets
   - Validation: Complete mapping for all patterns

8. **Update State File**
   - Add consolidation section to .state.yaml
   - Record before/after counts for all pattern types
   - Update phase to "consolidation_complete"
   - Log Brad's consolidation decisions
   - Validation: State updated with consolidation data

## Output

- **consolidation-report.md**: Executive summary with reduction metrics
- **color-clusters.txt**: Detailed color groupings with usage counts
- **button-consolidation.txt**: Button semantic analysis and recommendations
- **spacing-consolidation.txt**: Spacing scale proposal
- **typography-consolidation.txt**: Typography scale proposal
- **pattern-mapping.json**: Old pattern → new token mappings
- **.state.yaml**: Updated with consolidation decisions

### Output Format

```yaml
# .state.yaml consolidation section
consolidation:
  completed_at: "2025-10-27T12:30:00Z"
  patterns_consolidated:
    colors:
      before: 89
      after: 12
      reduction: "86.5%"
      clusters: 8
    buttons:
      before: 47
      after: 3
      reduction: "93.6%"
      variants: ["primary", "secondary", "destructive"]
    spacing:
      before: 19
      after: 7
      reduction: "63.2%"
      scale: ["xs", "sm", "md", "lg", "xl", "2xl", "3xl"]
    typography:
      before: 21
      after: 10
      reduction: "52.4%"
  overall_reduction: "81.8%"
  target_met: true
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] >80% overall pattern reduction achieved
- [ ] Color clustering uses HSL similarity (not just hex distance)
- [ ] Button variants identified by semantic purpose
- [ ] Spacing scale based on consistent base unit
- [ ] Most-used patterns preserved as primary tokens
- [ ] All consolidation decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] User can review and override before finalizing

## Error Handling

- **No audit data found**: Exit with message to run *audit first
- **Insufficient patterns to consolidate**: Report that codebase is already clean
- **Cannot achieve 80% reduction**: Explain why and show actual reduction achieved
- **Invalid state file**: Attempt to recover from backup or prompt re-audit

## Security Considerations

- Read-only analysis of patterns (no code modification)
- Validate user overrides to prevent injection
- Handle malformed color values safely
- Backup state file before overwriting

## Examples

### Example 1: Successful Consolidation

```bash
*consolidate
```

Output:
```
🎨 CONSOLIDATING COLORS...
Found 89 unique colors
Clustering with 5% HSL threshold...

CLUSTER 1 - Primary Blues (4 → 1):
  #0066CC (234 uses) <- KEEP
  #0065CB, #0067CD, #0064CA (merge)

CLUSTER 2 - Error Reds (3 → 1):
  #DC2626 (89 uses) <- KEEP
  #DB2525, #DD2727 (merge)

📊 CONSOLIDATION SUMMARY:
| Pattern    | Before | After | Reduction |
|------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Colors     | 89     | 12    | 86.5%     |
| Buttons    | 47     | 3     | 93.6%     |
| Spacing    | 19     | 7     | 63.2%     |
| Typography | 21     | 10    | 52.4%     |
| TOTAL      | 176    | 32    | 81.8%     |

✅ TARGET MET: >80% reduction achieved
✅ Report saved: outputs/design-system/my-app/consolidation/consolidation-report.md
```

### Example 2: User Override

```bash
*consolidate

Brad: "Merge #0066CC and #0052A3?"
User: "No, #0052A3 is intentional hover state"
Brad: "Override recorded. Keeping both."
```

## Notes

- HSL color space provides perceptual similarity (better than RGB/hex distance)
- Most-used pattern in each cluster becomes the canonical token
- Semantic button analysis looks for keywords: primary, main, secondary, default, danger, delete, destructive
- Spacing scale should use consistent base unit (4px or 8px)
- Manual overrides are respected and documented
- Run this after every audit to prevent pattern regression
- Brad says: "Numbers don't lie. 82% reduction = real savings."
