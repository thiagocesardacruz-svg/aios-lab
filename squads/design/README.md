# Design Squad

> Creative Design for Conversion

## Overview

The Design Squad transforms strategy into visual assets that sell. Responsible for:

- Ad creatives and performance visuals
- Social media content packs
- VSL visual structures
- Brand identity kits
- Landing page designs

**Key Rule:** Design does not decide strategy, write offers, or run media. It receives validated briefs and produces assets.
