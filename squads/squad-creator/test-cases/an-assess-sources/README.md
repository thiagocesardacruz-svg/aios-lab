## Key Findings

### Crown Jewel Identified: Capítulo 6

**The Equation of Value** is the intellectual foundation of Alex Hormozi's entire system.

**4 Pillars:**
1. Dream Outcome (the goal)
2. Perceived Probability of Achievement (certainty)
3. Time Delay (how long until results)
4. Effort & Sacrifice (cost to client)

**Why it matters:**
- Foundation for all offer structuring
- Principle applies to ANY business/product
- Counterintuitive insights (gratis can work, increasing price decreases churn)
- Actionable framework (you can apply it today)

**Extraction Priority:** URGENT

## Assessment Methodology

### Framework: 25 Binary Checkpoints

5 Dimensions × 5 Checkpoints each:

| Dimension | Checkpoints |
|-----------|------------|
| **Autenticidade** | Espontaneidade, Vulnerabilidade, Respostas Difíceis, Nuance, Storytelling |
| **Profundidade** | Porquê, Framework, Exemplos, Trade-offs, Cross-Domain |
| **Atualidade** | Recência, Contexto, Não Contradito, Evolução, Aplicabilidade |
| **Unicidade** | Contra-Mainstream, Vocabulário, Framework Original, Insight, Perspectiva |
| **Completude** | Playbook, Framework, Exemplos, Edge Cases, Profundidade |

### Scoring Calibration

**Principle:** "Score what exists, not what's missing"

- **PASS** = Evidence exists (not perfect)
- **FAIL** = Evidence completely missing
- **Partial** = Interpreted as PASS (generous)
- **Dúvida** = Interpreted as PASS (benefit of doubt)

**Special Rules Applied:**
- IF Profundidade = 5 AND Autenticidade ≥ 4 → Crown Jewel
- IF all dimensions ≥ 4.0 → Crown Jewel

### Haiku Bias Correction

Haiku models tend to under-score. Generous interpretation applied to:
- Profundidade (Capítulo 8): Cross-domain connection
- Atualidade (Leads): Non-contradiction assumption
- Unicidade (Models): Original framework assessment

## Using These Results

### For DNA Extraction
1. Read **haiku-output.yaml** for detailed checkpoint-by-checkpoint scoring
2. Reference **ASSESSMENT-SUMMARY.md** for tier justifications
3. Start with Crown Jewel (Capítulo 6)
4. Follow recommended sequence (Ouro sources after)

### For Quality Control
1. Verify **special rules applied** (Crown Jewel criteria met)
2. Check **calibration notes** (Haiku bias correction)
3. Review **methodology** in EXECUTION-REPORT.md
4. Validate **pass/fail criteria** per checkpoint

### For Stakeholder Communication
- **Executive:** Use ASSESSMENT-SUMMARY.md (3-page overview)
- **Technical:** Use EXECUTION-REPORT.md (methodology details)
- **Extraction Team:** Use haiku-output.yaml (detailed reference)

## Critical Insights from Assessment

### System Architecture
Alex's framework is **not one idea but a trinity:**

1. **Theory** (Capítulo 6: Equação de Valor)
   - HOW to quantify value
   - WHY prices work the way they do

2. **Methodology** (Capítulo 8: Pensamento Divergente)
   - HOW to generate infinite variations
   - WHY one product = 100 offer possibilities

3. **Implementation** (Leads + Models)
   - HOW to generate infinite demand (Core Four)
   - HOW to sequence offers for maximum profit (3-Stages)

**Without any of the three, the system breaks.**

### Why This Matters
Most entrepreneurs know ONE (usually offer structure). Alex mastered ALL THREE plus the sequencing that ties them together. This is the competitive advantage.

## Gaps Identified

### What We Don't Have Yet
1. Interview transcripts (only Tom Bilyeu URL)
2. YouTube video transcripts
3. Live/spontaneous content
4. 2023-2026 evolution
5. Community cohort recordings
6. Social media threads

### Why It Matters
These gaps represent ~20% potential additional value. If found, could identify:
- Recent framework evolution
- Market condition adaptations
- New counter-intuitive insights

### Recommendation
Search for these in order:
1. Tom Bilyeu interview (easiest, 30 min)
2. Tim Ferriss interview (if available)
3. Acquisition.com YouTube training videos
4. Twitter/LinkedIn threads (2023-2026)
