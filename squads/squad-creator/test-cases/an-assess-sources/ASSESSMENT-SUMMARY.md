## Individual Source Rankings

### 1. **Livro $100M Ofertas - Capítulo 6 (A Equação de Valor)** ⭐ CROWN JEWEL
**Overall Score: 5.0/5.0**

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Autenticidade** | 5/5 | Real examples (San Diego gym, photography), admits past mistakes, no teleprompter feel |
| **Profundidade** | 5/5 | Complete 4-pillar framework with trade-offs and cross-domain connections |
| **Atualidade** | 5/5 | Published 2022, timelessly applicable in 2026 |
| **Unicidade** | 5/5 | Original "Equation of Value" framework not seen elsewhere; counter-mainstream thinking |
| **Completude** | 5/5 | 40 pages, visual formula, 3+ real examples, edge cases covered |

**Why Crown Jewel?**
This chapter is the **intellectual foundation** of Alex's entire system. Without understanding how to quantify value (Dream Outcome + Perceived Probability - Time Delay - Effort), nothing else works. This is 80% of his strategic thinking.

**Extraction Priority: #1 (URGENT)**

**Key Frameworks to Capture:**
- The 4-pillar Value Equation formula
- Dream Outcome concept (status-driven desires)
- Psychological vs Logical solutions mental model
- Risk reversal and proof social principles

---

### 2. **Livro $100M Ofertas - Capítulo 8 (O Processo de Pensamento)** 🥇 OURO
**Overall Score: 4.8/5.0**

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Autenticidade** | 5/5 | Personal, conversational, interactive (asks reader to do Brick Exercise NOW) |
| **Profundidade** | 5/5 | Convergent vs Divergent thinking framework with specific examples |
| **Atualidade** | 5/5 | Timeless - creative thinking never goes out of style |
| **Unicidade** | 4/5 | Framework not original (Edward de Bono), but application to offers is unique |
| **Completude** | 5/5 | Practical exercise (120 seconds), 20 brick use cases, 25 pages |

**Why Ouro?**
This chapter explains **how Alex generates multiple offer variations**. Theory (Ch 6) tells you WHAT value is; this chapter tells you HOW to create 10 variations of the same product.

**Extraction Priority: #2 (HIGH)**

**Key Frameworks to Capture:**
- Convergent (mathematics) vs Divergent (creativity) thinking
- The Brick Exercise methodology
- How to generate 10+ variations of one product
- Problem-solution iteration patterns

---

### 3. **Livro $100M Leads - Seção I & II** 🥇 OURO
**Overall Score: 4.8/5.0**

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Autenticidade** | 5/5 | Raw personal stories ($150k refunds, bankruptcy, honest failures) |
| **Profundidade** | 5/5 | Core Four framework, 7-step Lead Magnet methodology, psychological connections |
| **Atualidade** | 5/5 | 2022 publication, strategies 100% applicable in 2026 |
| **Unicidade** | 4/5 | Core Four is simplification of 2×2 matrix (not novel), but Lead Magnet concept is original |
| **Completude** | 5/5 | 100 pages, real numbers ($6k first sale, $60k single day, $215k monthly profit) |

**Why Ouro?**
This section is **how Alex created infinite demand**. Without demand, perfect offers die. The Core Four (Warm Outreach, Content, Cold Outreach, Paid Ads) are the ONLY 4 ways to generate leads.

**Extraction Priority: #3 (HIGH)**

**Key Frameworks to Capture:**
- Core Four lead generation channels
- Lead vs Engaged Lead distinction
- 7-step Lead Magnet creation process
- Historical journey from bankruptcy to $4.4M/month
- Lead Magnet types: Reveal Problem, Sample/Trial, One Step of Multi-Step Process

### 4. **Livro $100m Modelos - Framework Completo + Insights** 🥇 OURO
**Overall Score: 4.4/5.0**

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Autenticidade** | 3/5 | More didactic/structured than narrative; less personal storytelling |
| **Profundidade** | 5/5 | 3-stage framework (Get/More/Max Money), decision trees, multiple sub-frameworks |
| **Atualidade** | 5/5 | 2022 publication, timeless business model architecture |
| **Unicidade** | 4/5 | 3-stages is original; counter-mainstream (first sale doesn't need profit) |
| **Completude** | 5/5 | 80 pages, 5 templates, checklists, McDonald's/rental car/gym examples, 30-60-90 plan |

**Why Ouro?**
This section is **operationalization**. It takes Value Equation (What) + Divergent Thinking (How) + Lead Generation (Demand) and creates the actual business machine. 3-Stages tell you WHEN to sell what.

**Extraction Priority: #4 (HIGH)**

**Key Frameworks to Capture:**
- 3-Stage GMMM model (Get Money / More Money / Max Money)
- Upsell types: Classic, Menu, Anchor, Rollover
- Downsell progression: Payment Plans → Trial with Penalty → Reduced Features
- Continuity multipliers (monthly 10.7% churn vs annual 2% churn)
- McDonald's principle: low-margin front-end, high-margin back-end

### 5. **Entrevista Tom Bilyeu (YouTube)** 🔴 BRONZE
**Overall Score: 0.2/5.0**

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Autenticidade** | 1/5 | File contains only URL, no content accessible |
| **Profundidade** | 0/5 | No transcript - impossible to assess |
| **Atualidade** | 0/5 | Unknown publication date |
| **Unicidade** | 0/5 | No content to evaluate |
| **Completude** | 0/5 | Empty file - zero actionable content |

**Why Bronze?**
The file contains **only a YouTube link** with no transcribed content. While Tom Bilyeu interviews are typically high-quality (conversational, non-scripted), there's no data to assess.

**Extraction Priority: DEFERRED (MEDIUM)**

**Action Required:**
- Transcribe YouTube video (auto-captions available)
- Estimated effort: 30 minutes
- Potential outcome: Could be Ouro or Crown Jewel (1-hour deep conversations are rich)

## Strategic Assessment

### Strengths of Source Collection

✅ **Theory-Practice Balance:** Capítulo 6 (theory) + Capítulo 8 (methodology) + Leads (distribution) + Models (operations) = complete system
✅ **Verifiable Numbers:** Alex provides specific metrics (5x ticket increase, $150k recovery, $4.4M/month) that authenticate claims
✅ **Non-Contradictory:** All sources align (no conflicting advice across books)
✅ **Implementation-Ready:** Each source includes actionable frameworks (formulas, checklists, exercises)
✅ **Timelessly Applicable:** Principles from 2017-2022 still 100% valid in 2026

### Critical Gaps

❌ **Interview Transcripts:** Only 1 URL, no content. Should have 10+ interviews (Tim Ferriss, Lex Fridman, etc.)
❌ **Video Content:** No YouTube transcripts or training videos referenced
❌ **Live/Conversational:** All sources are polished books. Missing spontaneous Q&A or live calls
❌ **Recent Evolution:** Books published 2022. No 2023-2026 content visible
❌ **Community Artifacts:** No Discord, group calls, or cohort recordings
❌ **Social Media Threads:** No Twitter/LinkedIn long-form threads captured

## Scoring Methodology Notes

**Binary Checkpoint Framework (v2.0):**
- Each source evaluated on **25 checkpoints** (5 dimensions × 5 each)
- PASS = evidence EXISTS (not perfect)
- FAIL = evidence MISSING
- Partial = PASS (generous interpretation)
- Dúvida = PASS (benefit of the doubt)

**Tier Thresholds:**
| Tier | Average Score | Checkpoints Passed | Meaning |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Crown Jewel** | ≥ 4.0 | 20-25 | Premium; 51% of extraction value |
| **Ouro (Gold)** | 4.0-3.0 | 15-19 | High quality; 33% of extraction value |
| **Mixed** | 3.0-2.0 | 10-14 | Supplementary; 16% of extraction value |
| **Bronze** | < 3.0 | < 10 | Skip; risk of noise |

**Special Rules Applied:**
- ✅ IF Profundidade = 5 AND Autenticidade ≥ 4 → Crown Jewel (Capítulo 6)
- ✅ IF todas dimensões ≥ 4.0 → Crown Jewel (Capítulo 6)

## Key Extraction Targets

### Most Valuable Frameworks
1. **Value Equation** (Ch 6) - 4 pillars, infinite pricing power
2. **Divergent Thinking** (Ch 8) - infinite offer generation
3. **Core Four** (Leads I-II) - infinite lead channels
4. **3-Stages GMMM** (Models) - infinite profit sequencing

### Most Memorable Stories
