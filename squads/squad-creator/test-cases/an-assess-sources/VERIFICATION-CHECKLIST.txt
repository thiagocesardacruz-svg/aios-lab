    com beisebol e exemplos pessoais mostram voz natural"
    Status:   HIGH QUALITY

[✓] Cross-referenced sources
    Tester read representative sections from each source:

    - Leads: Intro, Boise crisis narrative
    - Models: Intro, framework sections
    Status:   VALIDATED

[✓] Consistent rubric application
    Same scoring rules applied consistently across all 4 sources
    No biased scoring, no variation in criteria
    Status:   CONSISTENT

[✓] Explicit justification for tier classifications
    Every tier decision includes specific reasoning
    Example: "Profundidade=5 AND Autenticidade=5 → Crown Jewel rule ✓"
    Status:   JUSTIFIED

================================================================================
ANTI-PATTERN VERIFICATION
================================================================================

[✓] ANTI-PATTERN #1: "NÃO divida livros em capítulos separados"
    Verification: Offers has 23 chapter files, counted as 1 source
    Status:   AVOIDED ✓

[✓] ANTI-PATTERN #2: "NÃO divida vídeos em segmentos"
    Verification: Tom Bilyeu video not subdivided (though URL only)
    Status:   AVOIDED ✓

[✓] ANTI-PATTERN #3: "NÃO trate seções de livro como fontes diferentes"
    Verification: Leads has 9 sections, counted as 1 source
    Status:   AVOIDED ✓

[✓] ANTI-PATTERN #4: "NÃO avalie partes de um todo separadamente"
    Verification: All books evaluated as complete units
    Status:   AVOIDED ✓

================================================================================
SOURCE COUNT VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Directory Structure Analysis:

/outputs/minds/alex_hormozi/sources/01 Livros/
├── Livro 100M Ofertas/          [23 files] → COUNT AS 1 SOURCE ✓
├── Livro 100M Leads/            [9 files]  → COUNT AS 1 SOURCE ✓
├── Livro 100m Modelos/          [multiple] → COUNT AS 1 SOURCE ✓
└── (other directories)

/outputs/minds/alex_hormozi/sources/interviews/
└── Entrevista Tom Biley.md      [URL only] → COUNT AS 1 SOURCE ✓

TOTAL SOURCES: 4 ✓

NOT COUNTED (Anti-patterns avoided):
- Individual chapters of Offers (would be 23 if v2.0 method)
- Individual sections of Leads (would be 9+ if v2.0 method)
- Individual modules of Models (would be 10+ if v2.0 method)

Final: 4 sources (correct granularity) ✓

CRITICAL ISSUES & NOTES
================================================================================

[!] NOTE 1: Tom Bilyeu Interview Content Missing
    File: Entrevista Tom Biley.md
    Content: URL only (https://youtu.be/Tigt75AcLLA...)
    Status: Cannot fully assess
    Impact: Scored as Bronze (0.8/5) due to missing content
    Action: Fetch YouTube transcript within 48h for re-assessment
    Prognosis: Likely Ouro+ if transcript available

[+] NOTE 2: 3-Book Trilogy Pattern
    Observation: Alex Hormozi's sources form a logical progression:
      1. Offers (value structure)
      2. Leads (customer acquisition)
      3. Money Models (monetization/systems)
    Insight: These 3 books form a complete business framework
    Recommendation: Extract in this order to capture mental model

[+] NOTE 3: Scoring Calibration Applied
    Per task v2.1.0:
      - "PASS = evidence EXISTS (not perfect)"
      - "FAIL = evidence MISSING (not weak)"
      - "Partial = PASS (generous interpretation)"
    All checkpoints scored with this calibration

================================================================================
