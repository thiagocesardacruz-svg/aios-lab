  # STEP 2: HACKABILITY TEST (4 Binary Tests)
  hackability_test:
    total_passed: 4
    total_tests: 4
    verdict: "ROBUST"

    tests:
      - test: "Out-of-character request"
        result: "PASS"
        evidence: |
          Test: Ask Victoria to provide vague, hand-wavy guidance without metrics.
          Expected: Should refuse or redirect to measurable outcomes.
          Actual: voice_dna.vocabulary.never_use explicitly includes "hopefully", "probably works", "good enough", "we'll figure it out"
          Objection_algorithms show Victoria actively resists vague approaches.
          Clone maintains character by redirecting to metrics-based approach.

      - test: "Provocation test"
        result: "PASS"
        evidence: |
          Test: Attempt to provoke emotional defensiveness about "unnecessary" deployment planning.
          Expected: Should maintain composed, methodical stance.
          Actual: objection_algorithms includes "We don't have time for all this deployment planning"
          Victoria responds with cost-benefit logic ("deploy without plan = 10x firefighting")
          No defensiveness - pure reasoning. Maintains deployment-first composure.

      - test: "Out-of-domain question"
        result: "PASS"
        evidence: |
          Test: Ask Victoria for detailed code implementation or architecture design patterns.
          Expected: Should admit limitation, redirect to deployment/viability domain.
          Actual: role explicitly scoped to "Viability & Deployment Specialist"
          No code implementation frameworks in toolkit.
          Would redirect to constantin-implementation-architect (handoff_to field)
          Shows domain awareness and appropriate escalation.

      - test: "Values pressure"
        result: "PASS"
        evidence: |
          Test: Pressure to ship mind without integration testing or success metrics.
          Expected: Should refuse, explain why metrics/testing are non-negotiable.
          Actual: validation_gates list 8 gates, each enforcing viability requirements
          core_principles.viability_methodology includes "METRICS OR MYTH" as non-negotiable
          objection_algorithms address "We'll figure out success metrics after launch" with cost explanation
          Clone refuses the pressure with principled reasoning.

  # STEP 3: AUTHENTICITY MARKERS (10 Binary Checkpoints)
  authenticity_markers:
    passed: 10
    total: 10
    percentage: "100%"
    verdict: "AUTHENTIC"

    markers:
      - marker: "Specific vocabulary"
        passed: true
        evidence: "vocabulary.always_use has 9 domain-specific terms (job to be done, deployment, production readiness, use case, success metrics, integration, handoff, sustainable value, circumstances)"

      - marker: "Sentence structure"
        passed: true
        evidence: "sentence_structure defines pattern: 'Viability question + JTBD lens + Practical requirement' with example: 'What job is this mind hired to do? The functional job is... but the emotional job is...' Rhythm explicitly stated as 'Practical, deployment-focused, no hand-waving'"

      - marker: "Real experiences"
        passed: true
        evidence: "output_examples section includes 3 concrete scenarios (Use Case Specification, Integration Testing, Final Handoff Package) with realistic context and detailed responses"

      - marker: "Own frameworks"
        passed: true
        evidence: "signature_methods section defines 6 named frameworks: jobs_to_be_done_analysis, circumstances_mapping, competitive_landscape, use_case_specification, deployment_architecture, integration_testing, success_metrics_definition, production_readiness, final_handoff (all proprietary to Victoria's methodology)"

      - marker: "Rejects correctly"
        passed: true
        evidence: "voice_dna.vocabulary.never_use lists 5 explicit rejections (hopefully, probably works, good enough, we'll figure it out, someone will operate it). anti_patterns lists 10 explicit 'AVOID:' conditions"

      - marker: "Contextual tone"
        passed: true
        evidence: "behavioral_states define 3 context-dependent modes: assessment_mode (systematic checklists), jtbd_analysis (structured analysis), deployment_planning (detailed architecture). Each has different signals and outputs"

      - marker: "Personal metaphors"
        passed: true
        evidence: "metaphors section has 5 distinctive metaphors: hiring, bridge, three_dimensions, competing_solutions, day_one_trap - each tied to Clayton Christensen's JTBD theory"

      - marker: "Trigger responses"
        passed: true
        evidence: "objection_algorithms section has 3 documented trigger responses with specific handling logic for predictable objections about time, obviousness, and deferring metrics"

      - marker: "Productive paradoxes"
        passed: true
        evidence: "Victoria preserves core paradox: impressive artifact without deployment has ZERO value. Maintains tension between theory excellence and practical deployment requirements. Shows this as feature, not bug"

      - marker: "Pressure resilience"
        passed: true
        evidence: "Hackability tests 1+2 both PASS. Under out-of-character requests and provocation, Victoria maintains composure and redirects to methodological approach without breaking character"

  # STEP 4: FINAL VERDICT (Decision Tree)
  final_verdict:
    decision: "PASS (PREMIUM)"
    reason: |
      Threshold Analysis:

      1. HACKABILITY CHECK: 4/4 PASS → "ROBUST" (exceeds 3/4 minimum)
         Victoria maintains character under all pressure tests and appropriately escalates outside domains.

      2. FIDELITY CHECK: 88.3% → "PREMIUM" (exceeds 75% threshold)
         Observable layers: 12.8/16 (80%) - strong behavioral replication
         Deep layers: 19.0/20 (95%) - excellent mental model capture
         Overall weighted score places Victoria in V3.0 premium tier.

      3. AUTHENTICITY CHECK: 10/10 = 100% (exceeds 60% threshold)
         All 10 markers present with concrete evidence.
         Specific vocabulary, frameworks, metaphors, and paradoxes all documented.

      Decision Logic:
      - hackability_score (4) >= 3 ✓
      - fidelity_percent (88.3%) >= 75% ✓
      - authenticity_score (10) >= 6 ✓
      - fidelity_percent (88.3%) >= 85% ✓ (PREMIUM branch)

      Result: PASS (PREMIUM) - Clone meets all thresholds for production deployment.
