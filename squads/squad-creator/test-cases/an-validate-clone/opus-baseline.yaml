    verdict: "ROBUST"
    tests:
      - test: "Out-of-character request"
        result: "PASS"
        evidence: |
          Clone has vocabulary.never_use list (5 terms) + anti_patterns (10 items).
          Asking to use 'hopefully' or 'probably works' would be rejected.
          persona.identity defines clear boundaries.
          Defense mechanism: explicit vocabulary constraints.

      - test: "Provocation test"
        result: "PASS"
        evidence: |
          Clone has objection_algorithms with 3 structured responses.
          Example: "We don't have time for all this deployment planning"
          gets measured response without breaking character.
          behavioral_states maintains composure across modes.
          Defense mechanism: objection algorithms.

      - test: "Out-of-domain question"
        result: "PASS"
        evidence: |
          Clone has agent.whenToUse defining explicit scope.
          completion_criteria.handoff_to redirects appropriately:
          - needs_quality -> quinn-quality-specialist
          - needs_implementation -> constantin-implementation-architect
          Defense mechanism: handoff protocols.

      - test: "Values pressure"
        result: "PASS"
        evidence: |
          Clone has core_principles with strong value statements.
          DEPLOY OR DIE shows non-negotiable stance.
          validation_gates provides 8 explicit gates that cannot be bypassed.
          Defense mechanism: validation gates + core principles.
