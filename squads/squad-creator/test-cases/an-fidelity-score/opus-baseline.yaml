          meta_note: |
            These paradoxes are features, not bugs. Victoria's effectiveness
            comes from holding multiple truths simultaneously. The tension
            creates better outcomes than either extreme alone.

        productive_paradoxes:
          integration: |
            All of Victoria's paradoxes share a common resolution pattern:
            optimize for learning velocity. Speed serves learning, thoroughness
            serves sustainability, simplicity serves adoption. When in doubt,
            ask: "What helps us learn faster while building sustainable value?"

  trajectory:
    current_version: "V2.0"
    next_milestone: "V3.0 (Premium at 85%)"
    gaps_to_close: 6
    estimated_effort: "~2-3 hours"
    priority_gaps:
      - "Layer 8: Add productive_paradoxes section (4 checkpoints, +4 points = +11.1%)"
      - "Layer 4: Add heuristics with pattern IDs and thresholds (+2 points = +4.4%)"
      - "Layer 3: Add error_handling section (+1 point = +2.2%)"

  analysis:
    strengths:
      - "Excellent mental models (5/5): Christensen framework deeply integrated"
      - "Strong values hierarchy (5/5): Clear beliefs, defenses, and non-negotiables"
      - "Complete communication style (5/5): Voice DNA fully specified"
      - "Comprehensive behavioral patterns (5/5): All states and triggers defined"
      - "Clear obsessions (5/5): Jobs-to-be-Done permeates entire agent"

    weaknesses:
      - "Missing productive paradoxes (1/5): No explicit tension documentation"
      - "Incomplete recognition patterns (3/5): No numeric thresholds or pattern IDs"
      - "Missing error handling (4/5): No fallback procedures defined"

    recommendations:
      immediate:
        - "Add productive_paradoxes: section with Victoria's key tensions"
        - "Define numeric thresholds for validation gates"
        - "Add heuristic pattern IDs (VI_XX_NNN format)"
      future:
        - "Consider adding error_handling: to behavioral_states:"
        - "Document context-dependent behavior more explicitly"

  notes:
    calibration: "Scoring was generous as per v2.0 calibration guidance - evidence was counted if present"
    borderline_cases:
      - "Checkpoint 4.1 (red_flags): anti_patterns: counted as red flags"
      - "Checkpoint 4.2 (green_flags): quality_standards: counted as green flags"
      - "Checkpoint 6.5 (non-negotiables): DEPLOY OR DIE statement counted as non-negotiable"
      - "Checkpoint 7.5 (legacy_thinking): SUSTAINABLE VALUE statement counted as legacy thinking"
    victoria_specific: "Victoria is a strong agent with deep Christensen integration. The main gap is Layer 8 (paradoxes) which requires explicit documentation of tensions."
