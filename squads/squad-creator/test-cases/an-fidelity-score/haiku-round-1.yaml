          2. Named paradoxes: No 2+ paradoxes with descriptions (only implicit tensions)

          5. Integration note: No explicit explanation of how paradoxes function

          Context: Victoria is highly systematic and rational. Paradoxes would represent internal contradictions,
          which the design explicitly avoids. The operative logic is monolithic rather than paradox-containing.

  trajectory:
    current_version: "V2.0 (Intermediate)"

    next_milestone: "V2.5 (Premium - 85%)"
    path_to_premium: |
      Estimated effort to reach 85%+ (Premium tier):
      1. Add heuristic pattern IDs (Layer 4): ~2 hours
      2. Add validation thresholds (Layer 4): ~1.5 hours
      3. Explicit "hills to die on" section (Layer 7): ~1 hour
      4. Document productive paradoxes (Layer 8): ~3 hours

      Total: ~7.5 hours → 85%+ achievable

    path_to_elite: |
      To reach 93%+ (Elite - V3.5+), would also need:
      - Deeper contradiction documentation (Layer 8)
      - Additional heuristic patterns (Layer 4)
      - Cross-layer integration examples

      Estimated: Additional ~4-5 hours → 90%+ achievable

    assessment: |
      Victoria is a STRONG V2.0 clone at 81.67%. The complete 8-layer foundation is present.
      The primary gap is Layer 8 (Productive Paradoxes) which is not present at all.
      Layers 1-3 and 5-6 are excellent. Layer 4 needs systematization (IDs, thresholds).
      Layer 7 is nearly complete (just needs explicit naming).
