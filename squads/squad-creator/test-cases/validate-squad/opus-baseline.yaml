    type_detected: "Expert"
    key_strengths:
      - "Massive scale: 24 agents, 75 tasks, 55 checklists, 48 templates, 14 workflows - largest expert squad in the system"
      - "Deep voice_dna coverage: 22/24 agents (91.7%) with detailed voice patterns, behavioral states, and vocabulary constraints"

      - "100% checklist coverage ratio (55 checklists for 55 complex tasks)"
      - "Zero orphan tasks - every task referenced in agents, config, or workflows"
      - "Excellent documentation: README (812 lines), ARCHITECTURE.md (177 lines), config changelog"
      - "Research-first methodology: 37 research docs supporting task development"
      - "Atomic architecture: agents are modular (300-1500 lines core + external frameworks)"

    key_issues:
      - "alex-hormozi.md agent file MISSING despite being listed in config.yaml agents section and referenced in README"

  # RECOMMENDATIONS
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  recommendations:
    critical:
      - issue: "alex-hormozi.md agent file missing"
        component: "agents/"
        fix: "Create agents/alex-hormozi.md with proper voice_dna, output_examples, objection_algorithms, and activation-instructions. Config.yaml and README both reference this agent."
        impact: "T1-REF-001 warning, 4.2% missing reference rate"

    high:
      - issue: "No execution_type on tasks"
        component: "tasks/"
        fix: "Add execution_type field (Worker|Agent|Hybrid|Human) to all 75 tasks. At minimum, mark deterministic tasks (apply-sugarman-triggers, setup-split-test) as Worker."
        impact: "Optimization score 5.0/10, potential $10-15/month savings"

      - issue: "No explicit entry_agent in config.yaml"
        component: "config.yaml"
        fix: "Add 'entry_agent: copy-chief' at config root level for schema compliance"
        impact: "Structural consistency with squad validation expectations"

    medium:
      - issue: "No separate CHANGELOG.md"
        component: "root"
        fix: "Extract changelog from config.yaml comments into standalone CHANGELOG.md"
        impact: "Documentation best practice (HO-DP-001)"

      - issue: "3 unreferenced data files"
        component: "data/"
        fix: "Reference boron-letters-collier-dna.yaml in robert-collier agent, copy-scripts-extracted.yaml and plc-criteria-extracted.yaml in relevant PLF tasks"
        impact: "Data usage coverage from 81% to 100%"

      - issue: "Workflow failure branches incomplete"
        component: "workflows/"
        fix: "Add explicit rework rules and failure branches to workflow phase transitions"
        impact: "Pipeline coherence score improvement"

      - issue: "clayton-makepeace.md is compact (519 lines) with less detailed voice_dna"
        component: "agents/clayton-makepeace.md"
        fix: "Expand to match depth of other Tier 1 agents (1000+ lines) with full voice_dna sections"
        impact: "Voice DNA coverage quality consistency"

    validator: "Claude Opus 4.6 (Squad Architect v3.3 manual execution)"
    date: "2026-02-11"
    final_score: 7.89
    result: "PASS"
    note: "This is a mature, production-ready Expert squad with exceptional depth. The 24-agent tier system with voice_dna coverage and sophisticated orchestration makes it one of the most comprehensive expert squads. The main improvement area is operational optimization (execution_type declarations) and the missing alex-hormozi.md agent file."
