        status: CONDITIONAL
        notes: Workflows documented but outputs could be more explicit in specifications
    issues:
    - Phase outputs not explicitly defined in all workflow configurations
    - Automation script (copy.sh) exists but lacks comprehensive --help documentation
    - Some workflow phases could have more detailed output specifications
  phase_5_veto:

  executive_summary:
    final_score: 6.5/10
    result: CONDITIONAL
    type_detected: Pipeline
    key_strengths:
    - Exceptional checklist coverage (103.77% vs 30% required)
    - Strong orchestrator design with Copy Chief commanding 24 agents
    - 75 well-organized tasks across multiple domains
    - Comprehensive workflow system (14 workflows) with quality checkpoints
    - Tier-based agent organization enables sophisticated multi-expert orchestration
    - Excellent structural compliance (7/7 checks passed)
    key_issues:
    - Task prompt quality could include more explicit examples
    - Documentation is adequate but could be more comprehensive
    - Phase outputs need more explicit specification in workflow YAML
    - Some checklists need clearer actionability/measurability criteria
    - Automation script exists but needs better help documentation
  issues_by_priority:
    critical: []
    high:
    - issue: Workflow phase output specifications incomplete
      component: workflows/*.yaml
      impact: Reduces clarity of data flow between phases
      fix: 'Add explicit outputs: field to each phase with field names and types'
    medium:
    - issue: Some tasks lack input/output examples
      component: tasks/
      impact: Reduces clarity for task executors
      fix: Add "## Examples" section to 15-20% of tasks that currently lack them
    - issue: Documentation incomplete for getting started
      component: README.md, docs/
      impact: New users may struggle with activation
      fix: Expand README with step-by-step activation guide
    - issue: Checklist items use vague language
      component: checklists/
      impact: Ambiguous pass/fail criteria
      fix: Refactor checklist items to be YES/NO answerable
    low:
    - issue: Automation script missing --help flag
      component: scripts/copy.sh
      impact: Users must read source to understand options
      fix: Add help text output to copy.sh
  recommendations:
    immediate:
    - 'Add outputs: specification to each workflow phase'
    - Test copy-chief activation with actual workflow execution
    - Validate orchestrator can successfully delegate to all 24 agents
    short_term:
    - Add input/output examples to 25% of tasks (top-used ones first)
    - Create a "Quick Start" guide for new users
    - Refactor 5-10 checklists to improve actionability (more YES/NO items)
    - Add --help documentation to copy.sh script
    long_term:
    - Consider converting some deterministic format/parsing tasks to Worker executor
      type
    - Build CLI wrapper around copy.sh for easier workflow selection
    - Add telemetry/analytics to track which workflows are most used
    - Document best practices for multi-agent orchestration patterns
  quality_gates_status:
    tier_1_structure: PASS - All critical infrastructure present
    tier_2_coverage: PASS - Exceeds checklist coverage requirements
    tier_3_quality: CONDITIONAL - Meets minimum threshold (6.5/10) with clear improvement
      areas
    tier_4_contextual: CONDITIONAL - Pipeline elements present but some underspecified
    veto_check: PROCEED - No blocking conditions
