  analysis:
    root_cause: |
      Haiku was more conservative in swipe_file scoring:
      - Opus found examples in persona file (delegated)
      - Haiku only counted wrapper file (stricter interpretation)

      The task v2.0 says "Onde procurar: examples: ou swipe: ou samples:"
      Victoria's persona file has examples section, but wrapper doesn't.
      Haiku interpreted "clone file" literally, Opus looked at full context.

    pattern: "Literal vs contextual interpretation"

  qualification_decision:
    qualified: false
    reason: "MTQ_VC_004 - Verdict mismatch (SOLID vs NEEDS_WORK)"
    veto_triggered: true
    quality_percentage: "78.6%"  # Trinity match (11/14)
    final_status: "OPUS REQUIRED"

  recommendation:
    action: "CLARIFY_TASK"
    details: |
      Task needs clarification: Should trinity review include delegated persona files?

      Options:
      1. Clarify scope: "Review clone file AND referenced persona files"
      2. Keep strict: "Review only the main clone file"
      3. Add parameter: "scope: [wrapper_only | full_context]"

    compensatable: true
    compensation: |
      Add to task v2.1:
      "NOTE: If clone wrapper delegates to persona file, INCLUDE persona in review scope."
