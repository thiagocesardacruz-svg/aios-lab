  # STEP 1: SOURCE QUALITY REVIEW
  # ============================================================
  source_quality:
    total_sources: 0
    ouro_count: 0
    bronze_count: 0
    ouro_percentage: "N/A"
    curadoria_score: "N/A - No dedicated source files"

    analysis: |
      The Victoria clone does NOT have dedicated source files in a sources/ directory.
      Instead, it references inspiration sources directly in the agent definition:

      Inspiration Sources Listed (not extracted, just referenced):
      - "The Innovator's Dilemma (1997)"
      - "The Innovator's Solution (2003)"
      - "Competing Against Luck (2016)"
      - "How Will You Measure Your Life? (2012)"
      - Harvard Business School academic background

      CRITICAL: These are bibliographic references, NOT extracted DNA sources.
      The clone is a "persona-based agent" (inspired by Clayton Christensen),
      NOT a "mind clone" of a real person with extracted content.

    sources_checked: []

    recommendation: |
      This is NOT a mind clone in the traditional MMOS sense. It's a persona-based
      agent inspired by Clayton Christensen's frameworks. Source quality scoring
      does not apply - the relevant question is "framework fidelity" not "source curadoria".

        - "deployment_planning - Moving toward production"

    recommendation: |
      The clone has behavioral_states (3 modes) but they are NOT formal stages.
      Given:
      - 699 lines (>500 threshold)
      - 3 distinct behavioral modes with different triggers/outputs
      - Multiple contexts (assessment, JTBD, deployment)

      ASSESSMENT: Could benefit from formal stages but current behavioral_states
      provide similar functionality through trigger-based mode switching.

      Current implementation uses "soft stages" via behavioral_states:
      - assessment_mode: trigger="Evaluating readiness or viability"
      - jtbd_analysis: trigger="Defining use cases or value proposition"
      - deployment_planning: trigger="Moving toward production"

      This is a VALID alternative to formal stages for persona-based agents.

    summary: |
      The Victoria clone is a HIGH-QUALITY persona-based MMOS agent.

      STRENGTHS:
      - Perfect Playbook score (5/5): Clear workflows, outputs, and validation gates
      - Perfect Framework score (5/5): Rich decision trees, conditional logic, anti-patterns
      - Strong Swipe File (4/5): Good examples with input/output, but no [SOURCE:] tags
      - Excellent Fidelity (5/5): Complete voice DNA, thinking patterns, immune system

      KEY DISTINCTION:
      This is NOT a traditional "mind clone" (extracted from a real person's content).
      It is a PERSONA-BASED AGENT inspired by Clayton Christensen's frameworks.
      This is an intentional design choice, not a gap.

      ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
      Uses behavioral_states as "soft stages" rather than formal stages: section.
      This is a valid alternative for persona-based agents where mode-switching
      is trigger-based rather than sequence-based.

  # PRIORITY ACTIONS
  # ============================================================
  priority_actions:
    - action: "Add [SOURCE:] tags to output_examples if tracing to Christensen content is desired"
      target_component: "swipe_file"
      checkpoints_to_fix: [3]
      impact: "baixo"
      rationale: |
        Since this is a persona-based agent (not a mind clone), SOURCE tags
        are less critical. The examples are illustrative teaching tools, not
        extracted content. Low priority.

    - action: "Consider formalizing behavioral_states into explicit stages: section"
      target_component: "stages"
      checkpoints_to_fix: [1, 5]
      impact: "baixo"
      rationale: |
        Current behavioral_states work well. Formal stages would add complexity
        without clear benefit for this use case. The trigger-based mode switching
        is appropriate for a viability assessment specialist.

  next_version_path: "From 93.3% to 100% by adding SOURCE tags to examples"

  execution_notes: |
    This clone review was executed following the an-clone-review v2.0 task workflow.

    Key observations:
    1. The Victoria agent is a persona-based agent, not a traditional mind clone
    2. Source quality scoring does not apply (no extracted sources)
    3. The agent has excellent framework and workflow coverage
    4. Uses behavioral_states as alternative to formal stages

    The 93.3% Trinity score reflects the single gap in swipe_file checkpoint 3
    (lack of [SOURCE:] tags). This is expected for persona-based agents.
