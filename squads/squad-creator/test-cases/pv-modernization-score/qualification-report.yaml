  learning:
    key_insight: |
      NOT ALL CHECKLIST TASKS ARE HAIKU-ELIGIBLE.

      pv-modernization-score LOOKS deterministic (12-point PASS/FAIL)
      but REQUIRES nuanced judgment about "implemented vs described".

      Haiku-eligible checklists: Binary (file exists? score > X?)
      Opus-required checklists: Interpretive (is this REALLY implemented?)

    reclassification:
      from: "haiku (high confidence)"
      to: "opus (non-negotiable)"
      reason: "Task requires strict literal interpretation, not charitable reading"
