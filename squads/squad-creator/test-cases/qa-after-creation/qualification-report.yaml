  baseline:
    model: "opus"
    final_score: 8.32
    result: "APPROVED"
    type_detection: "EXPERT (95% confidence)"
    methodology: "Full 6-phase validation including type detection"

    tool_uses: 39
    duration_ms: 206004

  rounds:
    - round: 1
      model: "haiku"
      final_score: 9.9
      result: "APPROVED"
      type_detection: "N/A (not executed)"
      methodology: "5-phase quick validation (simplified)"
      tokens: 59289
      tool_uses: 26
      duration_ms: 170335
      quality_vs_baseline: "119%"
      gaps:
        - "Haiku gave HIGHER score than Opus (9.9 vs 8.32)"
        - "Haiku did NOT do type detection (Opus did EXPERT 95%)"
        - "Different validation methodology applied"
        - "Haiku used simplified checklist-based scoring"
        - "Opus used full validate-squad integration"

  decision:
    veto_triggered: false
    veto_id: null
    final: "HAIKU_QUALIFIED_WITH_CAVEAT"
    recommended_tier: "haiku"
    quality_achieved: "119%"
    threshold_required: "90%"

    caveats:
      - "Haiku score inflation (+19% vs Opus)"
      - "Different validation depth (Haiku simplified)"
      - "Type detection skipped in Haiku approach"

    rationale: |
      Both models produced APPROVED result - the final decision matches.
      Score difference (9.9 vs 8.32) is due to methodology difference:
      - Opus integrated full validate-squad (more rigorous)
      - Haiku used simplified checklist approach (faster, less deep)

      For QA-after-creation, the key outcome is APPROVED/REJECTED.
      Both reached same conclusion → Haiku is viable for this task.

  cost_analysis:
    opus_per_run: "$0.68"
    haiku_per_run: "$0.012"
    savings_if_haiku: "98.2%"
    savings_applicable: true
    reason: "Same final decision (APPROVED). Score difference acceptable for QA pass/fail."

  methodology_note: |
    qa-after-creation is a GATEKEEPER task:
    - Primary purpose: Pass/Fail decision after component creation
    - Secondary purpose: Quality score for tracking

    For pass/fail: HAIKU MATCHES OPUS ✓
    For score precision: HAIKU INFLATES (+19%)

    Recommendation: Use Haiku for QA gating decisions.
    If precise score needed, use Opus or add calibration.

  learning:
    pattern_identified: |
      GATEKEEPER tasks (binary pass/fail) are HAIKU-ELIGIBLE
      even if scores differ, as long as final decision matches.
