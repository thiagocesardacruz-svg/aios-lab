## Section 12: Cross-Reference with GOATed Ads

### How Hooks Fit in Ad Assembly
```
GOATed Ads Formula:
50 Hooks × 3-5 Meats × 1-3 CTAs = 150-750 Ads/week

Time Allocation:
├── 80% → Hooks (this checklist)
├── 20% → Meat (ad body)
└── ~0% → CTAs (set once, reuse)
```

### Handoff Points
- [ ] Complete hooks checklist FIRST
- [ ] Then assemble with meats from GOATed Ads SOP
- [ ] Performance data flows back to hooks library
- [ ] Iteration applies to both SOPs

### Shared Frameworks
- [ ] Same 5 awareness levels (Eugene Schwartz)
- [ ] Same "let the data teach" philosophy
- [ ] Same 70-20-10 allocation principle
- [ ] Same testing volume requirements
