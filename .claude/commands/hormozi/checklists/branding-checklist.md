## One Page Branding Checklist (from p.33)

Hormozi's original checklist from the playbook:

- [ ] Figure out who your ideal avatar is:
  - [ ] Growing
  - [ ] In Pain
  - [ ] Can afford your stuff
  - [ ] Easy to find
- [ ] Figure out what they like
- [ ] Associate yourself with the stuff they like through:
  - [ ] Making content they like
  - [ ] Making products they like (both free and paid)
  - [ ] Appearing next to people they like
- [ ] Grow your influence and direction - strategically associate with bigger things that the largest group of your potential customers like. You can go in five directions:
  - [ ] Up market
  - [ ] Down market
  - [ ] Broader market
  - [ ] Narrow market
  - [ ] Adjacent market
- [ ] To grow your reach even more... do more advertising
- [ ] Make your products match your promises, so you create a virtuous cycle of branding:
  - [ ] What you say -> What other people say -> What they say
- [ ] When you make mistakes (which you will), don't shrink away. Double down on what they like.
- [ ] **Wait five years and don't give up.**

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

- [ ] Accept some audience loss for quality

### Bad Publicity Event
- [ ] Don't try to eliminate or hide
- [ ] Launch positive association surge
- [ ] Continue until bad pairing irrelevant

### Pricing Pressure
