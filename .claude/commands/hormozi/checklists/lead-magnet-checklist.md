---

## Step 1: Problem Discovery

### Problem-Solution Cycle Validation

- [ ] All narrow problems listed (before broad solution needed)
- [ ] Each narrow problem assessed for:
  - [ ] Narrowness (specific, not broad)
  - [ ] Significance (people care about solving it)
  - [ ] Revelation strength (solving it reveals core offer problem)
- [ ] Winning problem selected with clear rationale

### Quality Gate QG-001
```
Pass Criteria:
- [ ] Problem is narrow (not "help them succeed" but "show them their home value")
- [ ] Problem reveals need for core offer when solved
```

  - [ ] Is it one-time solution?

### Type Selection Matrix

| If... | Select... | Because... |
|-------|-----------|------------|

   - Easy to access and use
   - Not too long/complex

4. [ ] **Makes the right people more likely to buy**

## Post-Launch Tracking

### Week 1 Metrics

|--------|--------|--------|
| Engagement rate | Higher than core offer | |
| Cost per engaged lead | Lower than without LM | |

|--------|--------|--------|
| LM to call rate | ~10% | |
| Customer acquisition cost | 3x lower | |
| ROI vs direct advertising | Positive | |

### Optimization Triggers

- [ ] Engagement low -> Re-test naming
