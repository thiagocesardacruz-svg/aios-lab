## Purpose

Validate that your upsell STRATEGY is complete and follows Hormozi's four upsell types framework. Use this checklist BEFORE designing upsell pages.

**Cross-Reference:** For PAGE element validation, see `upsell-page-checklist.md`

---

## Pre-Flight Check

Before designing any upsells, verify:

- [ ] **Core offer is profitable** - You have unit economics calculated
- [ ] **Customer journey mapped** - You understand what happens after purchase
- [ ] **Products/services exist** - You have things to upsell
- [ ] **Fulfillment capacity** - You can deliver on upsell promises
- [ ] **CRM configured** - You can track purchase history
- [ ] **Payment system ready** - Card-on-file capability exists

---

## SECTION A: Problem-Solution Chain Validation

### A.1: Problem Mapping

- [ ] **Core offer problem identified** - "What problem does the main offer solve?"
- [ ] **Revealed problem identified** - "What NEW problem does solving that create?"
- [ ] **Upsell solution exists** - "What product/service solves the new problem?"
- [ ] **Chain documented** - Written problem-solution map exists

**Template Check:**
```
[ ] "You can't have [Core Benefit] without [Upsell Benefit]"
Example: "You can't have a clean car without sealant"
```

### A.2: Chain Continuation

- [ ] **Each upsell reveals another problem** - Chain continues
- [ ] **Chain is 3+ levels deep** - Multiple upsell opportunities
- [ ] **Problems are genuine** - Not manufactured or forced
- [ ] **Solutions are valuable** - Actually help customer

---

## SECTION B: Classic Upsell Validation

## Quick Reference: Key Validation Points

### Must-Have Before Launch

1. **Problem-solution chain documented** - Know what you're solving
2. **Profit ordering applied** - Highest margin first
3. **At least 2 of 4 upsell types ready** - Classic + one other minimum
4. **Scripts for all active types** - No improvisation
5. **BAMFAM enforced** - Culture embedded
6. **Metrics tracked** - Know what's working

### Common Failures to Avoid

1. **Anchor not genuine** - Customers sense fakeness
2. **Rollover credit too high** - Eating margins
3. **No unselling** - Missing trust-building
4. **No BAMFAM** - Leaving money on table
5. **One upsell only** - Missing the 11.6x opportunity

### McDonald's Reminder

```
Hamburger alone: $0.25 profit
With fries: $0.25 + $0.75 = $1.00
With combo: $1.00 + $1.75 = $2.75
With supersize: $2.75 + $1.00 = $3.75

Multiplier: 15x (from $0.25 to $3.75)

"Se o McDonald's nao fizesse upsell de batatas fritas e refrigerante,
nao haveria McDonald's."
```
