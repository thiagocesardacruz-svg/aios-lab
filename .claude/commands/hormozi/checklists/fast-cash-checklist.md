## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Not Selling Fast Enough

- [ ] **ACTION**: Add value to offer before remaining sends
- [ ] **QUOTE**: "Consider adding things to the offer to make it more compelling"

### High Opens, Low Conversions
- [ ] Review offer clarity
- [ ] Review price vs. value presentation
- [ ] Check CTA friction (too many steps?)
- [ ] **ACTION**: Simplify purchase process

### Customer Backing Out
- [ ] Identify reason
- [ ] Improve onboarding/reassurance
- [ ] Send back-out notification to waitlist
- [ ] **ACTION**: Fill spot immediately

### List Fatigue (for future campaigns)
- [ ] Extend cooldown to 6 months
- [ ] Increase value content between campaigns
- [ ] Ensure scarcity was real (don't fake sold-out)
- [ ] **QUOTE**: "If you feel you need to give it longer than twelve weeks to cool off between promotions, run it twice a year instead"
