## Pre-Implementation Assessment

### Leverage Scenario Identification
- [ ] **Assess Current State** - Which scenario are you in?
  - [ ] Scenario #1: You alone (High Work, Low Leads, Low Leverage)
  - [ ] Scenario #2: One lead getter (Low Work, Low Leads, High Leverage)
  - [ ] Scenario #3: Many lead getters (High Work, High Leads, Higher Leverage)
  - [ ] Scenario #4: Lead getters who get lead getters (Low Work, High Leads, Highest Leverage)

### Baseline Metrics
- [ ] **Calculate Referral Rate** = Referrals / Total Customers = _____%
- [ ] **Calculate Churn Rate** = Churned Customers / Total Customers = _____%
- [ ] **Referral vs. Churn Assessment**:
  - [ ] Referrals > Churn (Growing without other advertising)
  - [ ] Referrals = Churn (Need advertising to grow)
  - [ ] Referrals < Churn (Advertising just to survive)
- [ ] **Calculate Current LTGP:CAC Ratio** = $_____ : $_____ = _____:1

## Section I: Customer Referrals

### Phase 1: Diagnose Why Referrals Aren't Happening

**Problem #1: Product Not Good Enough**
- [ ] Ask yourself: "If my product were exceptional, would people already know about it?"
- [ ] Ask yourself: "Why are my customers too embarrassed to tell everyone they know?"
- [ ] Check NPS score (target: >50)
- [ ] Review customer complaints and common issues
- [ ] If product is the issue: STOP referral tactics, focus on Phase 2

**Problem #2: Not Asking for Referrals**
- [ ] Audit current referral asks (when, how, how often)
- [ ] If no system exists: proceed to Phase 3
- [ ] If system exists but weak: optimize existing before adding new

---

### Phase 2: Build Goodwill (Six Ways to Give More Value)

**Way #1: Sell Better Customers**
- [ ] Identify your most successful customers
- [ ] Find what they have in common (demographics, behaviors, timing)
- [ ] Document the "ideal customer profile"
- [ ] Update targeting to match ideal profile
- [ ] Narrow messaging to speak directly to ideal profile
- [ ] Track: Are new customers getting better results?

**Way #2: Set Better Expectations**
- [ ] List all promises made in marketing/sales
- [ ] For each promise, rate: Can we always exceed it?
- [ ] Lower promises that we sometimes miss
- [ ] Continue lowering until close rates decrease
- [ ] Stop at optimal point (maximum closes + maximum exceed)
- [ ] Document the new promise levels

**Way #3: Get Better Results for More People**
- [ ] Survey customers to identify top performers
- [ ] Interview top 10% - What did they do different?
- [ ] List common actions among top performers
- [ ] Create checklist of "success behaviors"
- [ ] Force new customers to do these behaviors (in onboarding)
- [ ] Match guarantee conditions to success behaviors
- [ ] Measure: Are average results improving?

**Way #4: Make Faster Wins**
- [ ] Map customer journey from purchase to result
- [ ] Identify every possible "win" along the way
- [ ] Break big deliveries into smaller increments
- [ ] Schedule progress updates (never go silent)
- [ ] Force multiple wins in first 48 hours
- [ ] Implement BAMFAM (always schedule next contact)
- [ ] Add 50% buffer to all deadlines
- [ ] Track: Time to first win = _____ hours/days

**Way #5: Keep Improving Your Stuff (Monthly Cycle)**
- [ ] Set recurring monthly meeting for this
- [ ] Collect: Customer service issues, surveys, reviews
- [ ] Identify #1 most common problem
- [ ] Interview customers who succeeded despite problem
- [ ] Design fix based on feedback
- [ ] Test with small group of struggling customers
- [ ] If solved: launch to all customers
- [ ] If not solved: iterate and re-test
- [ ] Move to next problem, repeat

**Way #6: Tell Them What to Buy Next**
- [ ] Audit: What can customers buy after initial purchase?
- [ ] If nothing: design next offer
- [ ] Create system to offer next thing after major wins
- [ ] Track: % of customers who buy second product
- [ ] Ensure customers don't "drop off" with nowhere to go

---

### Phase 3: Ask for Referrals (Seven Methods)

**Method #1: One-Sided Referral Benefit**

- [ ] Train team on asking for three-way introductions
- [ ] Script: "If you refer a friend and they sign up, you get $___"
- [ ] Always ask for real introduction (call/text/email), not just name

**Method #2: Two-Sided Referral Benefits**
- [ ] Split CAC between referrer and friend
- [ ] Example: $100 cash to referrer + $100 off for friend
- [ ] Set up tracking for both rewards
- [ ] Communicate benefit to BOTH parties clearly
- [ ] Monitor: Which party is more motivated by their benefit?

**Method #3: Ask Right When They Buy**
- [ ] Add referral ask to sales script/checkout
- [ ] Script: "People who do this with someone else get 3x results. Who would you want to do this with?"
- [ ] Train salespeople to ask and wait for answer
- [ ] If they have someone: get three-way intro immediately
- [ ] Track: Referrals generated at point of sale

**Method #4: Referrals as Negotiation Chip**
- [ ] Prepare script for price objections
- [ ] Script: "I can't lower the price, but if you introduce me to 3 friends right now, I'll waive the initiation fee"
- [ ] Get introductions before giving discount
- [ ] If customer asks about others' discounts: "They got it for referrals. Want $X off? Who are you thinking of?"
- [ ] Track: Referrals from negotiations

**Method #5: Referral Events (Time-Bound)**
- [ ] Plan event (1-4 week duration)

## Section II: Employees

### Phase 1: Mindset Shift

---

### Phase 2: Recruit Employees (Internal Core Four)

**Apply Customer Acquisition Methods to Employee Acquisition**

- [ ] Paid Ads → Promote job openings
- [ ] Customer Referrals → Employee referral program

- [ ] Agencies → Recruiting firms

---

**D1: Document**
- [ ] Write out exact steps of your lead generation process
- [ ] Have observer watch you and document what you do
- [ ] Record yourself doing the work multiple ways

- [ ] Create second draft checklist

**D3: Duplicate**

- [ ] If wrong result + wrong directions: more practice
- [ ] Repeat until consistently correct
- [ ] Celebrate when they get it right

**Clarity Test**
- [ ] Answer honestly: "If I disappeared, could a stranger replicate my results from this checklist alone?"
- [ ] If no: improve checklist until answer is yes

---

### Phase 4: Training Best Practices

- [ ] Remember: If they err, WE erred (fix checklist, not employee)
- [ ] If step needs explanation, step is too complicated (simplify)
- [ ] Competence vs. performance: they may know but need practice
- [ ] Focus on following directions, not just outcomes
- [ ] Praise every success (even if result wrong but directions followed)
- [ ] No punishment during training
- [ ] Give one piece of feedback at a time
- [ ] If performance drops: they stopped doing important step (find and retrain)

---

### Phase 5: Calculate Employee ROI

- [ ] Calculate: Total Payroll for lead generation = $_____
- [ ] Calculate: Total Engaged Leads generated = _____
- [ ] Cost per Engaged Lead = Payroll / Leads = $_____
- [ ] Calculate: Leads needed per customer = _____
- [ ] Employee CAC = Cost per Lead x Leads per Customer = $_____
- [ ] LTGP:CAC Ratio = LTGP / Employee CAC = _____:1
- [ ] Target: At least 3:1 ratio

---

### Phase 6: Diagnose Employee Issues

**If CAC is too high, ask:**
"Do my engaged leads have the problem I solve AND the money to spend?"

| Answer | Problem Type | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| No | Advertising | Fix targeting/messaging, don't fire sales |
