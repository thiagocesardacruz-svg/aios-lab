## The 4 Pillars of Lead Nurture

### Pillar 1: AVAILABILITY
Be reachable through multiple channels.
- Phone
- Email
- SMS
- Social DM
- Chat

**Rule:** The more ways they can reach you, the more likely they will.

### Pillar 2: SPEED
Respond faster than anyone else.
- Under 5 minutes for new leads
- Under 1 hour for existing conversations
- Under 24 hours for all inquiries

**Data:** Leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert.

### Pillar 3: PERSONALIZATION
Make them feel like the only customer.
- Use their name
- Reference their situation
- Customize recommendations

**Rule:** Generic = ignored. Personal = engaged.

### Pillar 4: VOLUME
More touches = more chances.
- Multiple touchpoints per day
- Multiple channels
- Keep going until they buy or die

**Rule:** Most people give up too early. Persistence wins.
