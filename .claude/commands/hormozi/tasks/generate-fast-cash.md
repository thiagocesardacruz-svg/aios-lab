## Fast Cash Hierarchy

Start with highest probability, work down:

### Level 1: Past Customers (Highest Probability)
They already bought. They already trust you.
- Upsell to existing customers
- Win back churned customers
- Ask for referrals

### Level 2: Warm Contacts
They know you but haven't bought.
- Friends and family
- Past colleagues
- Social media connections

### Level 3: Engaged Audience
They follow you but you don't know them.
- Email list
- Social followers
- Community members

### Level 4: Cold Contacts (Lowest Probability)
They don't know you yet.
- Only when 1-3 are exhausted
