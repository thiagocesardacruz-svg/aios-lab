## Purpose
Create a complete paid ad campaign using the GOATed Ads Assembly Process — making 150-750 ads per week that scale.

## The Story: From 5 Ads/Month to 600 Ads/Month

> "Why don't you scale your ads?" I asked one of our portfolio founders.
> "Every time we try, we hit a wall. We've just saturated this market."
> "Bro you sell weight loss on Facebook and spend $200,000 per month on ads."
> "Yeah, but it's the only thing that can explain it. After about 5-8k per day in ad spend, our cost to acquire customers shoots through the roof."
> "How often are you recording new ads?"
> "At least once a month."
> "Wait. You're only making ads once a MONTH?"
> "Yeah...at least!"
> "How many new ads do you get?"
> "At least five, sometimes a few more."
> **"I figured out the problem. You're gonna take 'at least five' and change it to 'at least 500'."**

**Result:** The company doubled in two quarters.

## Why Ads Hit A Wall

> "You haven't saturated Facebook. But you have gotten all the low hanging fruit. You've hit a wall with your ad QUALITY, not with the market. The better your ads, the bigger the audience they'll convert."

### Eugene Schwartz — Awareness Levels

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           LARGEST AUDIENCE (COLD)               │
│                                                 │
│  5) Completely Unaware - Doesn't know they      │
│     have a problem                              │
│                                                 │
│  4) Problem-Aware - Knows the problem, doesn't  │
│     know solutions exist                        │
│                                                 │
│  3) Solution-Aware - Knows solutions exist,     │
│     doesn't know your product                   │
│                                                 │
│  2) Product-Aware - Knows your product, not     │
│     sure it's right for them                    │
│                                                 │
│  1) Most Aware - Knows your product, just       │
│     needs to know the deal                      │
│                                                 │
│          SMALLEST AUDIENCE (HOT)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> "In the beginning, you start with the smallest but highest converting eyeballs. Then, as you scale, you go to progressively larger but lower-converting eyeballs."

**The solution:** Make BETTER ads that convert colder audiences.

---

## The Assembly Process

> "I realized it was much harder to make a bunch of ads at once and much easier to make the ads in PARTS."

### The 3 Parts of Every Ad

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. HOOK     — Stops the scroll (3 seconds)     │
│  2. MEAT     — Delivers the message (value)     │
│  3. CTA      — Tells them what to do            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Time Allocation (CRITICAL)

| Part | % Time | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| HOOKS | 80% | "If they don't make it through the hook, nothing else matters" |
| MEAT | 20% | "The body gets rotated less often, doesn't 'use up' as fast" |
| CTAs | ~0% | "Once you have one that works, stick with it" |

### Production Math

```
50 hooks × 3-5 meats × 1-3 CTAs = 150 to 750 ads/week
```

> "This is how you scale advertising. It also gives you the side benefit of no one being able to figure out your top performing ads. Good offense AND good defense against copycats."

## PART 1: Hooks (80% of Time)

### Hooks for Immediate Results (Previous Winners)

Look for converting hooks in:
1. **Your own winning ads** — winners you reuse
2. **Your free content** — hooks that performed on other platforms
3. **Other people's ads** — save in a phone album
4. **Other people's content** — content with lots of views in your space
5. **Platform ad libraries** — last resort (hard to know what performs)

### Expansion Hooks (For New Markets)

For each awareness level, write appropriate hooks:

| Level | Hook Type | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Most Aware | Offer-driven | "50% off our best-selling XYZ for the rest of the month" |
| Product-Aware | Proof-driven | "Discover why 10,000 people chose XYZ to solve their [problem]" |
| Solution-Aware | Promise-driven | "The fastest way to [achieve desired result] — introducing XYZ" |
| Problem-Aware | Pain-driven | "Tired of [specific problem]? There's a better way" |
| Unaware | Curiosity-driven | "The hidden danger in your daily routine that's costing you [money/time/health]" |

### B2C Examples (Weight Loss Shake "XFast")

1. **Most Aware:** "XFast's new formula: Now with 25% more protein - Same great taste!"
2. **Product-Aware:** "Why 9 out of 10 XFast users reached their goal weight within 3 months"
3. **Solution-Aware:** "Lose 15 pounds in 30 days with our scientifically proven meal replacement system"
4. **Problem-Aware:** "Frustrated with crash diets that don't last? There's a sustainable way to shed pounds"
5. **Unaware:** "The hidden hormonal imbalance that's making 1 in 3 Americans gain weight"

### B2B Examples (Marketing Agency "DigitalBoost")

1. **Most Aware:** "DigitalBoost: Now offering social media management at 20% off for new clients"
2. **Product-Aware:** "See how DigitalBoost increased ROI by 150% for 5 different industries"
3. **Solution-Aware:** "Double your online sales in 6 months with our data-driven marketing strategies"
4. **Problem-Aware:** "Is your website getting sales? You might be missing these crucial elements"
5. **Unaware:** "The unexpected way your business is losing $1000s each month in untapped revenue"

### Pro Tip: Widest Hooks Possible

> "Memes or meme-like content attract the largest percentage of your audience. A relevant meme for a specific audience works like a moth to a flame."

---

## PART 2: Meat (20% of Time)

> "Usually three to five per weekly recording session is more than enough."

## PART 3: CTA (Call To Action)

> "If you don't tell anyone to take action, you will have significantly fewer people taking action."

### Clear > Clever

S-P-E-L-L it out: Click this button. Call this number. Reply with "YES". Go to this website.

### A Good CTA Shows and Tells:

1. **What to do:** "Take advantage of this great offer by..."
2. **How to do it:** "...tapping the button on the bottom of your screen..."
3. **When to do it:** "...before it expires..."
4. **What they get for doing it:** "...and you'll get $1000 of free stuff..."
5. **What happens next:** "...delivered straight to your inbox."

### Pro Tip: Show What Happens Next

> "Demonstrate what it would look like for them to follow the next step. Show what happens when they click the button. Show where they'll need to fill out their information. Actually walk through the next steps."

**Also add:** Urgency, scarcity, guarantees, bonuses.

## GOATed Ads Cheat Sheet

### Step 1 — Figure out the level of awareness you're targeting

### Step 2 — Write 50 hooks
Divide into buckets that hit each awareness level OR focus most broader than your current hooks.

Inspiration:
1. Your prior best ads
2. Top ads from other industries (gold here)
3. Your past top short content
4. Others' best short content
5. Favorite saved ads

### Step 3 — Write 3-5 "meats"
Pick from:
1. **Demonstration** — showcasing, unboxing, comparisons, hero ads
2. **Testimonial** — UGC, direct to camera, podcast, raw iPhone, walk n talk, parade of proof
3. **Education** — explainer, how-to, whiteboard, listicle, high performing organic
4. **Story** — storytelling, lifestyle, emotional, humor, manifesto, problem-solution
5. **Faceless** — screenshots, text only, slideshows, animations, cartoons

### Step 4 — Write 1-3 CTAs
Show and tell:
1. What/how to do it
2. When to do it
3. What they get for doing it
4. What happens next
5. Demonstrate visually

### Step 5 — Try to find a new winner
Repeat steps 1-4.
