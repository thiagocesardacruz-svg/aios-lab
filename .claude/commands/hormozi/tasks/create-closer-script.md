## The CLOSER Framework

### C — CLARIFY (5-7 minutes)
Understand why they're really here.

**Goals:**
- Get them talking
- Understand their situation
- Identify the real problem

**Questions:**
```
"What made you decide to [schedule this call / reach out]?"

"How long has this been a problem for you?"

"What have you tried so far to fix it?"

"On a scale of 1-10, how important is solving this to you?"
```

### L — LABEL (2-3 minutes)
Name their problem with empathy.

**Goals:**
- Show you understand
- Get them to say "yes, exactly"
- Create emotional connection

**Script:**
```
"So if I'm hearing you correctly...

You're dealing with [PROBLEM], which is making you feel
[EMOTION]. You've tried [PAST ATTEMPTS] but nothing has
worked, and you're concerned that if you don't fix this,
[CONSEQUENCE].

Is that right?"
```

### O — OVERVIEW (5-7 minutes)
Paint past failures and future ideal.

**Goals:**
- Contrast where they are vs where they want to be
- Let THEM describe the dream outcome
- Create urgency through vision

**Questions:**
```
"What would your life look like if this was solved?"

"If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different?"

"What would solving this mean for [their business/life/family]?"
```

### S — SELL (5-7 minutes)
Present solution as vehicle to THEIR vision.

**Goals:**
- Connect your solution to THEIR words
- Show how it gets them to their described future
- Handle mechanism objections

**Script:**
```
"Based on what you've told me...

You want [THEIR DREAM OUTCOME from Overview].

Here's how [SOLUTION] gets you there:

[COMPONENT 1] helps you [BENEFIT using their language]
[COMPONENT 2] handles [OBSTACLE they mentioned]
[COMPONENT 3] ensures [RESULT they described]

Does that make sense?"
```

### E — EXPLAIN (5-10 minutes)
Handle objections as information requests.

**Goals:**
- Treat objections as questions, not rejections
- Provide information, not arguments
- Close after each objection

**Framework:**
```
"I totally understand. [OBJECTION] is a valid concern.

Let me share some information that might help:
[RELEVANT INFO/STORY/PROOF]

Does that address your concern?"
```

### R — REINFORCE (2-3 minutes)
Eliminate buyer's remorse immediately.

**Goals:**
- Confirm they made a great decision
- Set clear expectations
- Create excitement for next steps

**Script:**
```
"You made a great decision today.

Here's what happens next:
- [STEP 1]
- [STEP 2]
- [STEP 3]

By [DATE], you'll be [FIRST RESULT].

Do you have any questions before we get started?"
```

---

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "I need to think about it"
```
"Of course. What specifically do you need to think about?

Is it the [price / timing / fit]?

If I can answer that question now, would you be ready
to move forward?"
```

### "It's too expensive"
```
"I understand. Let me ask you this:

If I could show you how to get [THEIR STATED RESULT],
and it paid for itself in [TIMEFRAME], would the
investment make sense?

[Use Socratic price algorithm if needed]"
```

### "I need to talk to my spouse/partner"
```
"That makes total sense. What do you think they'll
want to know?

Let's go through those questions now so you can
give them great answers.

What's their biggest concern likely to be?"
```

### "Not the right time"
```
"I hear that a lot. Can I ask what would make it
the right time?

What needs to change?

Is there anything we could do to make it work now,
or is this truly a timing issue?"
```
