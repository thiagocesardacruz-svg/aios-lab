# RISKS & MITIGATION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

risks:
  - risk: "Creative fatigue on winning ads"
    impact: "High"
    mitigation: "Weekly hook rotation, retire ads with frequency >3"

  - risk: "Budget overspend on underperformers"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Automated kill checks twice daily, strict decision matrix"

  - risk: "Platform policy violations (ads rejected)"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Pre-review all ads for compliance, avoid restricted claims"

  - risk: "Attribution challenges (multi-touch)"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Use platform-specific tracking + GA4 for cross-platform view"

  - risk: "Scaling too fast degrades performance"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "20% increment rule, 48-hour monitoring post-scale"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# NOTES & BEST PRACTICES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

notes:
  - "Hormozi principle: Volume beats perfection. Test fast, iterate faster."
  - "Conley principle: Emotional resonance in hooks. Speak to dreams and fears."
  - "Schrager principle: Category design. Position hotel as unique category, not commodity."
  - "Never let winning ads run until death. Retire at frequency >3 or declining CTR."
  - "Always have 10+ new hook variations in testing pipeline."
  - "70-20-10 is sacred. Don't over-allocate to experiments or under-invest in winners."
  - "Platform-specific optimization matters. TikTok ≠ Meta ≠ Google."
  - "Attribution is imperfect. Use directional data, not absolute truth."
