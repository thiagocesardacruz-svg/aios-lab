# NOTES & BEST PRACTICES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

notes:
  - "Hormozi principle: Systems beat effort. Automate what you can, personalize what matters."
  - "Conley principle: Emotional connection in responses. Show you care, not just corporate speak."
  - "Schrager principle: Reputation is brand. Protect and elevate it relentlessly."
  - "Research shows: +1 star = +5-9% revenue. Reputation management is revenue management."
  - "MRR (Meaningful Response Rate) matters more than generic 'thank you' responses."
  - "Negative reviews are recovery opportunities, not disasters. 60%+ can be turned around."
  - "Review request timing matters: 48 hours is the sweet spot (fresh memory, not too pushy)."
  - "Never incentivize reviews with discounts (violates platform policies). Request genuinely."
  - "UGC from reviews is gold. Always ask permission, always give credit."
  - "Competitor monitoring provides differentiation insights and service benchmarks."
